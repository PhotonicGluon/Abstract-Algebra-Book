\section{Definition and Examples of Rings}
We follow \cite[p.~223]{dummit_foote_2004}, \cite[p.~115, Definition 1.1]{hungerford_1980}, and \cite{proofwiki_ringdefinition} for the definition of a ring.
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{ring}\index{ring} is a set $R$ with two binary operations $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ satisfying the following axioms.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Closure}\index{axiom!addition!closure}: For all elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$, $a \oplus b$ is also in $R$.
        \item \textbf{Addition-Associativity}\index{axiom!addition!associativity}: For all elements $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $R$, we have $a \oplus (b \oplus c) = (a \oplus b) \oplus c$.
        \item \textbf{Addition-Identity}\index{axiom!addition!identity}: There exists an element 0 in $R$ such that, for any element $x \in R$, we have $x \oplus 0 = x$.
        \item \textbf{Addition-Inverse}\index{axiom!addition!inverse}: For every element $x$ in $R$, there exists an element $-x$ in $R$ such that $x \oplus (-x) = 0$.
        \item \textbf{Addition-Commutative}\index{axiom!addition!commutative}: For all elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$, we have $a \oplus b = b \oplus a$.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Closure}\index{axiom!multiplication!closure}: For all elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$, $a \otimes b$ is also in $R$.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Associativity}\index{axiom!multiplication!associativity}: For all elements $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $R$, we have $a \otimes (b \otimes c) = (a \otimes b) \otimes c$.
        \item \textbf{Distributive}\index{axiom!distributive}: $\otimes$ is distributive over $\oplus$. That is,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $a \otimes (b \oplus c) = (a \otimes b) \oplus (b \otimes c)$; and
            \item $(a \oplus b) \otimes c = (a \otimes c) \oplus (b \otimes c)$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    One may denote such a ring by $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    An equivalent condition for the five axioms involving the addition operation is that $(R, \oplus)$ forms an abelian group.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Other authors (e.g. \cite[p.~136]{cohn_1982}, \cite[pp.~145--146]{clark_1984}) may include another axiom for a ring:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Identity}\index{axiom!multiplication!identity}: There exists an element 1 in $R$ such that, for any element $x \in R$, we have $x \otimes 1 = 1 \otimes x = x$.
    \end{itemize}
    In this book, any ring that satisfies the above condition is called a \textbf{ring with identity}\index{ring!with identity}.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    A ring that satisfies the condition that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Commutative}\index{axiom!multiplication!commutative}: For all $a$ and $b$ in $R$, we have $a \otimes b = b \otimes a$.
    \end{itemize}
    is called a \textbf{commutative ring}\index{ring!commutative}.
\end{remark}

We often write $\oplus$ using the standard addition symbol $+$. The multiplication symbol $\otimes$ is usually omitted. This means that $x \oplus y$ is written as $x + y$ and $x \otimes y$ is written as $xy$.

The additive identity of $R$ will always be denoted by 0 and the additive inverse of the element $x$ will be denoted by $-x$.

Let's look at some examples of rings.
\begin{example}
    We show that $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$, where $\oplus_n$ and $\otimes_n$ denote addition and multiplication modulo $n$ respectively, form a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item From Volume I we know that $(\Zn, \oplus_n)$ is an abelian group.
        \item Clearly $a \otimes_n b \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\} = \Zn{n}$, so the $\Zn{n}$ is closed under $\otimes_n$.
        \item Multiplication is associative, so multiplication modulo $n$ is associative.
        \item It is clear that $\oplus_n$ and $\otimes_n$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$ is a ring. Furthermore, $\otimes_n$ has an identity of 1 and is commutative. Hence $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$ is a commutative ring with identity.

    Note that, in this volume, $\Zn{n}$ refers to the ring $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    We show that $(\Q, +, \times)$, where $+$ and $\times$ denote normal addition and multiplication, form a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item From Volume I we know that $(\Q, +)$ is an abelian group.
        \item Clearly multipliying two rational numbers together produce a rational number, so $\Q$ is closed under multiplication.
        \item Multiplication is associative.
        \item It is clear that $+$ and $\times$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Q, +, \times)$ is a ring. Furthermore, $\times$ has an identity of 1 and is commutative. So, just like $\Zn{n}$, we see that $(\Q, +, \times)$ is a commutative ring with identity.

    Note that, in this volume, $\Q$ refers to the ring $(\Q, +, \times)$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that $\Z$ is a ring under regular addition and multiplication.\newline
    (\textit{You do \textbf{not} need to prove the \textbf{Distributive} axiom.})
\end{exercise}
Note that, in this volume, $\Z$ refers to the ring $(\Z, +, \times)$.

\section{Ring of $n \times n$ matrices}
We now look at an interesting ring: the ring of $n \times n$ matrices.

Let $\Mn{n}{R}$ denote the set of $n\times n$ matrices with entires in the ring $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$ (or simply just $R$).
We need to define addition and multiplication within this set.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define \textbf{matrix addition}\index{matrix addition} within this set. Suppose we have $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$, and let their sum be $\textbf{C} = \textbf{A} + \textbf{B}$. Then
    \[
        c_{i,j} = a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}    
    \]
    where $\oplus$ is the addition operation in the ring $R$.
    
    \item We define \textbf{matrix multiplication}\index{matrix multiplication} within this set. Suppose $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$, and let their product be $\textbf{C} = \textbf{AB}$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        c_{i,j} &= (a_{i,1}\otimes b_{1,j}) \oplus (a_{i,2}\otimes b_{2,j}) \oplus \cdots \oplus (a_{i,n}\otimes b_{n,j})\\
        &= \sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k}\otimes b_{i,k})
    \end{align*}
    where $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ are the addition and multiplication operations in the ring $R$ respectively.
\end{itemize}
With these operations defined, we claim that
\begin{proposition}
    $\Mn{n}{R}$ is a ring under matrix addition and matrix multiplication.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We need to prove that the ring axioms hold.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Closure}: Clearly the sum of any two matrices in $\Mn{n}{R}$ is also a square matrix with $n$ rows with elements inside $R$, meaning that $\Mn{n}{R}$ is closed under matrix addition.

        \item \textbf{Addition-Associative}: Let the matrices $\textbf{A}$, $\textbf{B}$, and $\textbf{C}$ belong inside $\Mn{n}{R}$. We show that $\textbf{A} + (\textbf{B} + \textbf{C}) = (\textbf{A} + \textbf{B}) + \textbf{C}$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item %TODO: Finish associative proof
        \end{itemize}
        Hence matrix addition is associative.

        \item \textbf{Addition-Identity}: Denote the $n \times n$ matrix with contains only the zero in $R$ by $\textbf{0}_n$. One sees clearly that this is the identity in $\Mn{n}{R}$ as $\textbf{M} + \textbf{0}_n = \textbf{M}$ for any matrix in $\Mn{n}{R}$.
        
        \item \textbf{Addition-Inverse}: Let $\textbf{A} \in \Mn{n}{R}$. Define the matrix $\textbf{B} = -\textbf{A}$ where
        \[
            b_{i,j} = -a_{i,j},    
        \]
        that is, $b_{i,j}$ contains the additive inverse of $a_{i,j}$ in the ring $R$. Then one sees that $\textbf{A} + \textbf{B} = \textbf{0}_n$.\newline
        (Note that we denote the additive inverse of a matrix $\textbf{M}$ by $-\textbf{M}$.)

        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Closure}: In Volume I we showed that matrix multiplication produces another $n \times n$ matrix. Furthermore the entires of the new matrix are elements of $R$. Hence $\Mn{n}{R}$ is closed under matrix multiplication.
        
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Associative}: We proved matrix multiplication is associative in Volume I.
        
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: % TODO: Add distributive proof
    \end{itemize}
    As all the ring axioms are satisfied, thus $\Mn{n}{R}$ is a ring.
\end{proof}
For brevity, let $\Mn{n}{R}$ denote the ring under matrix addition and multiplication.

\section{Basics of Rings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We note the following.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(\Z, +)$ is an abelian group by Volume I.
        \item Multiplying two integers always results in an integer, so $\Z$ is closed under $\times$.
        \item We know $\times$ is associative.
        \item We know $+$ and $\times$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Z, +, \times)$ is a ring.
