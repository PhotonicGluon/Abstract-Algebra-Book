\chapter{Introduction to Rings}
\section{Basic Algebraic Structures}
In Volume I, we looked exclusively at groups and their operations. We discussed how groups are a generalisation of symmetry and looked at results related to groups. In this volume, we look at rings.

Before we introduce rings, we look at `simpler' algebraic structures and build our way up to them.

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{magma}\index{magma} is a set $M$ together with a binary operation $\ast$ which is closed. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $M$, then $a \ast b \in M$. Such a magma is denoted $(M, \ast)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider the set $M = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with the operation $\ast$ such that $(M, \ast)$ has the Cayley table as shown below.
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            $\ast$     & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} \\ \hline
            \textbf{1} & 1          & 2          & 1          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{2} & 2          & 3          & 4          & 1          \\ \hline
            \textbf{3} & 1          & 3          & 4          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{4} & 2          & 1          & 2          & 1          \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    
    Clearly for any $a, b\in M$ we have $a \ast b \in M$, so $(M, \ast)$ is a magma.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{semigroup}\index{semigroup} is a magma $(\mathcal{S}, \ast)$ where the operation $\ast$ is associative. That is, $a\ast(b\ast c) = (a\ast b)\ast c$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider the set $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with the operation $\ast$ such that $(S, \ast)$ has the Cayley table as shown below.
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            $\ast$     & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} \\ \hline
            \textbf{1} & 1          & 1          & 1          & 1          \\ \hline
            \textbf{2} & 2          & 2          & 2          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{3} & 3          & 3          & 3          & 3          \\ \hline
            \textbf{4} & 4          & 4          & 4          & 4          \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    
    One sees that $(S, \ast)$ is closed under $\ast$. In addition, $\ast$ is associative. Hence $(S, \ast)$ is a semigroup.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{monoid}\index{monoid} is a semigroup $(M, \ast)$ with an element $e$, called the \textbf{identity}, such that
    \[
        e \ast m = m \ast e = m
    \]
    for all $m \in M$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Let $X$ be a set. Let the set
    \[
        S = \{f \vert  f: X \to X\}.
    \]
    and let $\circ$ denote function composition. Then $(S, \circ)$ forms a monoid:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Closure}: If $f, g \in S$ then $f\circ g \in S$ since function composition is closed.
        \item \textbf{Associative}: Function composition is associative.
        \item \textbf{Identity}: The identity function $\id: X \to X, x\mapsto x$ is inside $S$ and
        \[
            \id \circ f = f \circ \id = f
        \]
        for all $f \in S$.
    \end{itemize}
    Thus $(S, \circ)$ forms a monoid.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{group}\index{group} is a monoid $(G, \ast)$ where every element has an inverse. That is to say, for every $g \in G$, there exists $g^{-1} \in G$ such that
    \[
        g \ast g^{-1} = g^{-1} \ast g = e
    \]
    where $e$ is the identity in $G$.
\end{definition}

\section{Definition of a Ring}
With all that setup, we are ready to define what a ring is. Note that we follow \cite[p.~223]{dummit_foote_2004}, \cite[p.~115, Definition 1.1]{hungerford_1980}, and \cite{proofwiki_ringdefinition} for the definition of a ring.
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{ring}\index{ring} is a set $R$ with two binary operations $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ satisfying the following axioms.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: $(R, \oplus)$ is an abelian group.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: $(R, \otimes)$ is a semigroup.
        \item \textbf{Distribution}: $\otimes$ is distributive over $\oplus$. That is,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $a \otimes (b \oplus c) = (a \otimes b) \oplus (b \otimes c)$; and
            \item $(a \oplus b) \otimes c = (a \otimes c) \oplus (b \otimes c)$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    One may denote such a ring by $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Other authors (e.g. \cite[p.~136]{cohn_1982}, \cite[pp.~145--146]{clark_1984}) may require that $(R, \otimes)$ is a monoid. In this book, any ring that satisfies the above condition is called a \textbf{ring with identity}\index{ring!with identity}.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    A ring where $a \otimes b = b \otimes a$ for all $a$ and $b$ in $R$ is called a \textbf{commutative ring}\index{ring!commutative}.
\end{remark}

We end this chapter by introducing the \textbf{trivial ring}.
\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{trivial ring}\index{trivial ring} (or \textbf{zero ring}\index{zero ring}), denoted $\textbf{0}$, is the ring $(\{0\}, +, \times)$ where
    \[
        0 + 0 = 0 \text{ and } 0 \times 0 = 0.    
    \]
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
    Prove that the trivial ring is a commutative ring with identity.
\end{exercise}

\section{Basic Examples of Rings}
Before we introduce some examples of rings, we make some remarks for the notation that is used in Ring Theory.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We often write $\oplus$ using the standard addition symbol $+$, so $x \oplus y$ is written as $x + y$.
    \item The multiplication symbol $\otimes$ is usually omitted, so $x \otimes y$ is written as $xy$.
    \item The additive identity of $R$ will always be denoted by 0.
    \item The additive inverse of the element $x$ will be denoted by $-x$.
    \item $n$ applications of $\oplus$ on an element $x$ will be denoted $nx$ (and will be denoted $-nx$ if the element is $-x$).
    \item $n$ applications of $\otimes$ on an element $x$ will be denoted $x^n$ (and will be denoted $x^{-n}$ if the element is $x^{-1}$ and if it exists).
\end{itemize}

Let's look at some examples of rings.
\begin{example}
    We show that $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$, where $\oplus_n$ and $\otimes_n$ denote addition and multiplication modulo $n$ respectively, form a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: From Volume I we know that $(\Zn, \oplus_n)$ is an abelian group.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We can see that $(\Zn, \otimes_n)$ is a semigroup as
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\Zn{n}$ is closed under $\otimes_n$ because $a \otimes_n b \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\} = \Zn{n}$; and
            \item multiplication is associative, so multiplication modulo $n$ is associative.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Distribution}: It is clear that $\oplus_n$ and $\otimes_n$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$ is a ring. Furthermore, $\otimes_n$ has an identity of 1 and is commutative, so in fact $(\Zn, \otimes_n)$ is a commutative monoid. Therefore $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$ is a commutative ring with identity.

    Note that, in this volume, $\Zn{n}$ refers to the ring $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    We show that $(\Q, +, \times)$, where $+$ and $\times$ denote normal addition and multiplication, form a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: From Volume I we know that $(\Q, +)$ is an abelian group.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We note that $(\Q, \times)$ is a semigroup as
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Q$ is closed under $\times$ because multiplying two rational numbers together produce a rational number; and
            \item multiplication is associative.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Distribution}: It is clear that $+$ and $\times$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Q, +, \times)$ is a ring. Furthermore, $\times$ has an identity of 1 and is commutative. So, just like $\Zn{n}$, we see that $(\Q, +, \times)$ is a commutative ring with identity.

    Note that, in this volume, $\Q$ refers to the ring $(\Q, +, \times)$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that $\Z$ is a ring under regular addition and multiplication.\newline
    (\textit{You do \textbf{not} need to prove the \textbf{Distributive} axiom.})
\end{exercise}
Note that, in this volume, $\Z$ refers to the ring $(\Z, +, \times)$.

We look at one more ring: the ring of $n \times n$ matrices.

Let $\Mn{n}{R}$ denote the set of $n\times n$ matrices with entries in the ring $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$ (or simply just $R$).
We need to define addition and multiplication within this set.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define \textbf{matrix addition}\index{matrix addition} within this set. Suppose we have $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$, and let their sum be $\textbf{C} = \textbf{A} + \textbf{B}$. Then
    \[
        c_{i,j} = a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}    
    \]
    where $\oplus$ is the addition operation in the ring $R$.
    
    \item We define \textbf{matrix multiplication}\index{matrix multiplication} within this set. Suppose $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$, and let their product be $\textbf{C} = \textbf{AB}$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        c_{i,j} &= (a_{i,1}\otimes b_{1,j}) \oplus (a_{i,2}\otimes b_{2,j}) \oplus \cdots \oplus (a_{i,n}\otimes b_{n,j})\\
        &= \sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k}\otimes b_{i,k})
    \end{align*}
    where $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ are the addition and multiplication operations in the ring $R$ respectively.
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}
    $\Mn{n}{R}$ is a ring under matrix addition and matrix multiplication.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We need to prove that the ring axioms hold. For cl
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: We first prove that $(\Mn{n}{R}, +)$ is indeed an abelian group.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Closure}: Clearly the sum of any two matrices in $\Mn{n}{R}$ is also a square matrix with $n$ rows with elements inside $R$, meaning that $\Mn{n}{R}$ is closed under matrix addition.

            \item \textbf{Associative}: Let the matrices $\textbf{A}$, $\textbf{B}$, and $\textbf{C}$ belong inside $\Mn{n}{R}$. Let $\textbf{P} = \textbf{A} + (\textbf{B} + \textbf{C})$ and $\textbf{Q} = (\textbf{A} + \textbf{B}) + \textbf{C}$. We note that $\textbf{P} = \textbf{Q}$ as
            \begin{align*}
                p_{i,j} &= a_{i,j} \otimes (b_{i,j} \otimes c_{i,j})\\
                &= (a_{i,j} \otimes b_{i,j}) \otimes c_{i,j} & (\otimes\text{ is associative})\\
                &= q_{i,j}
            \end{align*}
            which proves that matrix addition is associative.
    
            \item \textbf{Identity}: Denote the $n \times n$ matrix with contains only the zero in $R$ by $\textbf{0}_n$. One sees clearly that this is the identity in $\Mn{n}{R}$ as $\textbf{M} + \textbf{0}_n = \textbf{M}$ for any matrix in $\Mn{n}{R}$.
            
            \item \textbf{Inverse}: Let $\textbf{A} \in \Mn{n}{R}$. Define the matrix $\textbf{B} = -\textbf{A}$ where
            \[
                b_{i,j} = -a_{i,j},    
            \]
            that is, $b_{i,j}$ contains the additive inverse of $a_{i,j}$ in the ring $R$. Then one sees that $\textbf{A} + \textbf{B} = \textbf{0}_n$.\newline
            (Note that we denote the additive inverse of a matrix $\textbf{M}$ by $-\textbf{M}$.)

            \item \textbf{Commutative}: Let $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$. Set $\textbf{C} = \textbf{A} + \textbf{B}$ and $\textbf{D} = \textbf{B} + \textbf{C}$. Then
            \begin{align*}
                c_{i,j} &= a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}\\
                &= b_{i,j} \oplus a_{i,j} & (\oplus \text{ is commutative})\\
                &= d_{i,j}
            \end{align*}
            which means $\textbf{C} = \textbf{D}$.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We now need to prove that $(\Mn{n}{R}, \cdot)$ is a semigroup.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Closure}: In Volume I we showed that matrix multiplication produces another $n \times n$ matrix. Furthermore the entries of the new matrix are elements of $R$. Hence $\Mn{n}{R}$ is closed under matrix multiplication.
        
            \item \textbf{Associative}: We proved matrix multiplication is associative in Volume I.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Distribution}: We prove only $\textbf{A}(\textbf{B} + \textbf{C}) = (\textbf{AB}) + (\textbf{AC})$ as the other case is proven similarly.
        
        Let $\textbf{R} = \textbf{A}(\textbf{B} + \textbf{C})$, $\textbf{G} = \textbf{AB}$, and $\textbf{H} = \textbf{AC}$. We note
        \begin{align*}
            r_{i,j} &= \sum_{k=1}^n \left(a_{i,k} \otimes \left(b_{k,j} \oplus c_{k,j}\right)\right)\\
            &= \sum_{k=1}^n \left((a_{i,k} \otimes b_{k,j}) \oplus (a_{i,k} \otimes c_{k,j})\right)\\
            &= \left(\sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k} \otimes b_{k,j})\right) \oplus \left(\sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k} \otimes c_{k,j})\right)\\
            &= g_{i,j}\otimes h_{i,j}
        \end{align*}
        which means $\textbf{R} = \textbf{G} + \textbf{H}$.
    \end{itemize}
    As all the ring axioms are satisfied, thus $\Mn{n}{R}$ is a ring.
\end{proof}
For brevity, we let $\Mn{n}{R}$ denote the ring under matrix addition and multiplication.

\section{Types of Rings}
We now look at more specific types of rings.
\begin{definition}
    An \textbf{integral domain}\index{integral domain} $R$ is a commutative ring with identity such that for elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$,
    \[
        ab = 0 \text{ if and only if } a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{division ring}\index{division ring} $R$ is a non-trivial ring such that every non-zero element $x$ in $R$ has a multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$ where
    \[
        xx^{-1} = x^{-1}x = 1.    
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{field}\index{field} is a commutative division ring.
\end{definition}
We look at fields in more detail in Volume III.
