\begin{questions}
    \item We prove the ring axioms.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: $(\{0\}, +)$ is an abelian group since this is just the trivial group.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: $(\{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group since this is, again, just the trivial group. So $(\{0\}, \cdot)$ is a semigroup.
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: We know $+$ and $\cdot$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\{0\}, +, \cdot)$ is a commutative ring with identity.
\end{questions}
