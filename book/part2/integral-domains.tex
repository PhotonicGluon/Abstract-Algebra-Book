\chapter{Integral Domains}
Unlike groups, rings do not inherently have the `cancellation law' built in. Rings may have zero divisors, which break the cancellation law. We look at a special category of rings, called domains, and commutative domains, called integral domains.

\section{What are Domains and Integral Domains?}
\begin{definition}
    A \term{domain}\index{domain!ring} is a ring with identity without zero divisors.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Recall that a non-zero element $a$ is a zero divisor if there exists a non-zero $b$ in the ring such that $ab = 0$. So, equivalently, if $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$ then $ab \neq 0$ for any $a$ and $b$ in the domain.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    What this property grants us is a ``cancellation law'', similar to that for groups. We will prove this in \myref{prop-domain-cancellation-law}. However, there may not be inverses when performing multiplication.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    An \term{integral domain}\index{integral domain} is a commutative domain.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    This is similar to how the only way for two integers to multiply to zero is if both integers are zero, hence the name ``integral domain''.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}\label{example-integers-is-integral-domain}
    We show that the integers, $\Z$, the namesake for integral domains, is indeed an integral domain. We note that $\Z$ is a commutative ring as multiplication is commutative. Furthermore, 1 is the multiplicative identity in $\Z$. All that remains is to show that there does not exist any zero divisors in $\Z$.

    Suppose $a$ and $b$ are non-zero elements in $\Z$. We show that $ab \neq 0$ to prove that there does not exist any zero divisors. Let's first consider the case when $b > 0$. We may write
    \[
        ab = \underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}_{b \text{ times}}
    \]
    which clearly is not zero since $a \neq 0$. Now if $b < 0$ then note
    \[
        ab = (-a)(-b) = \underbrace{(-a) + (-a) + \cdots + (-a)}_{(-b) \text{times}}
    \]
    which is also not zero as $-a \neq 0$. Hence there are no zero divisors in $\Z$.

    Therefore $\Z$ is a commutative ring with identity without any zero divisors, meaning that $\Z$ is an integral domain.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    We show that the ring $\Z[i]$, the Gaussian integers, is an integral domain. Similar to $\Z$, we note multiplication is commutative with identity 1.

    Suppose $w$ and $z$ are non-zero elements in $\Z[i]$; write $w = a+bi$ and $z = c+di$. Note that $a^2+b^2 \neq 0$ and $c^2 + d^2 \neq 0$. By definition of complex multiplication we have
    \[
        wz = (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i.
    \]
    We just need to show that $ac-bd \neq 0$ and $ad+bc \neq 0$. Note that for any real numbers $x$ and $y$, we have $x^2 + y^2 \neq 0$ if and only if both $x$ and $y$ are non-zero. So we see
    \begin{align*}
        (ac-bd)^2 + (ad+bc)^2 &= (a^2c^2 - 2abcd + b^2d^2) + (a^2d^2 + 2abcd + b^2c^2)\\
        &= a^2c^2 + a^2d^2 + b^2c^2 + b^2d^2\\
        &= (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2)\\
        &\neq 0
    \end{align*}
    which hence means that $ac-bd \neq 0$ and $ad+bc \neq 0$. Therefore $wz \neq 0$, meaning that $\Z[i]$ has no zero divisors. Thus $\Z[i]$ is indeed an integral domain.
\end{example}

Let's look at some non-examples of domains.
\begin{example}
    The ring $\Mn{n}{R}$ where $R$ is any ring and $n$ is any integer greater than 1 is not a domain since, for $n = 2$, we have the non-zero matrices
    \[
        A = \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix} \text{ and } B = \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}
    \]
    which have a product that is the zero matrix. Thus $\Mn{n}{R}$ has zero divisors, meaning that $\Mn{n}{R}$ is not a domain (and hence not an integral domain).
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    The ring $2\Z$ is not a domain as it does not contain a multiplicative identity (namely, 1). Thus $2\Z$ is also not an integral domain.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    The ring $\Z \times \Z$ under pairwise addition and multiplication is not a domain as $(0,1) \neq (0, 0)$ and $(1, 0) \neq (0, 0)$ but $(0,1)(1,0) = (0, 0)$, meaning that $\Z \times \Z$ contains a zero divisor.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that the ring
    \[
        \Z[\sqrt2] = \left\{a + b\sqrt2 \vert a,b \in \Z\right\}
    \]
    is an integral domain.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
    Let $n$ be a composite number. Prove that $\Z_n$ is not an integral domain.
\end{exercise}

\newpage

We note an interesting result regarding fields here.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop-field-is-integral-domain}
    Any field is an integral domain.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Any non-zero element in a field is a unit, i.e. has an inverse. Now by \myref{prop-zero-divisors-have-no-inverses}, any zero divisor must not have an inverse; the contrapositive being that any element that has an inverse cannot be a zero divisor. Hence, there are no zero divisors in a field. Now a field is commutative, therefore meaning that the field is an integral domain.
\end{proof}

\section{General Properties and Results}
With an introduction of domains and integral domains out of the way, we introduce some general results applicable to them.
\begin{proposition}[Cancellation Law for Domains]\index{cancellation law!domains}\label{prop-domain-cancellation-law}
    Let $D$ be a domain, $r, x, y \in D$, and $r \neq 0$. Then the following statements are equivalent.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $x = y$
        \item $rx = ry$
        \item $xr = yr$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We prove the statements in order.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\boxed{(1) \implies (2)}$ Given $x = y$, this means $x - y = 0$. Multiplying $r$ on the left on both sides yields $r(x-y) = r0 = 0$. Distributing yields $rx - ry = 0$ which hence means $rx = ry$.

        \item $\boxed{(2) \implies (3)}$ Given $rx = ry$. Multiplying $r$ on the right on both sides yields $rxr = ryr$, thereby meaning $rxr - ryr = 0$. Factoring yields $r(xr - yr) = 0$. As $R$ is a domain, the only way for this to occur is if $r = 0$ (which is impossible) or $xr - yr = 0$. Therefore $xr = yr$.

        \item $\boxed{(3) \implies (1)}$ Given $xr = yr$ we may write $xr - yr = (x-y)r = 0$. Since $R$ is a domain we must have $x - y = 0$ or $r = 0$ (impossible as $r \neq 0$). Hence $x = y$.
    \end{itemize}
    This proves the proposition.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thrm-finite-integral-domain-is-field}
    Every finite integral domain is a field.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    A finite integral domain is a commutative ring with identity; all that remains is to prove that every non-zero element has an inverse.

    Suppose $D$ is a finite integral domain and take a non-zero element $r \in D$. Consider
    \begin{align*}
        A &= \{r^k \vert k \in \Z,\;k\geq 0\}\\
        &= \{1, r, r^2, r^3, \dots\}\\
        &\subseteq D.
    \end{align*}
    Note that since $D$ is finite, $A$ must be finite as well. Therefore there must exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $m > n$ such that $r^m = r^n$, meaning $r^m - r^n = 0$. As $m > n$, thus $r^n\left(r^{m-n}-1\right) = 0$. Hence, as there are no zero divisors in $R$, either $r^n = 0$ or $r^{m-n} - 1 = 0$.

    Now, seeking a contradiction, suppose $r^n = 0$. Then $n > 1$ since $r^1 = r \neq 0$ by assumption. Note $r^n = rr^{n-1} = 0$, which hence means $r^{n-1} = 0$ as $r \neq 0$ and $D$ has no zero divisors. But we may repeat this argument on $n - 1$ to eventually terminate at $r = 0$, which is a contradiction. Hence we must conclude that $r^{m-n} - 1 = 0$. We may write $r^{m-n}-1 = 0$ as $rr^{m-n-1} = 1$ which means that $r$ is a unit (with $r^{m-n-1}$ is its inverse). Therefore every non-zero element has an inverse.

    Hence $D$ is a field.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    We note that finite fields are also known as \term{Galois fields}\index{Galois Field}, so-named in honour of \'Evariste Galois. We explore more properties of fields and Galois fields in part III.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}\label{example-Zp-is-field}
    Let $p$ be a prime and consider the ring $\Z_p$. Clearly multiplication is commutative with identity 1. We just need to show that $\Z_p$ has no zero divisors. So suppose $a,b \in \Z_p$ such that $ab = 0$ in $\Z_p$. Thus $ab = pk$ for some integer $k$; Euclid's lemma (\myref{corollary-euclid}) tells us that $p \vert a$ or $p \vert b$, which means $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ in $\Z_p$. Thus there are no zero divisors in $\Z_p$, so $\Z_p$ is an integral domain. Now $\Z_p$ is finite as it only has $p$ elements; by \myref{thrm-finite-integral-domain-is-field} we know that $\Z_p$ is a field.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    We show that $\Z_3[i] = \{a+bi \vert a,b \in \Z_3\}$ is a finite integral domain in order to show that it is a field. Clearly multiplication is commutative with identity 1, so we just need to show that there are no zero divisors in $\Z_3[i]$.

    From the table, we have shown that no two non-zero elements in $\Z_3[i]$ multiply to zero. Therefore $\Z_3[i]$ has no zero divisors, which means $\Z_3[i]$ is an integral domain. Furthermore, as $\Z_3[i]$ is finite, therefore it is a finite field by \myref{thrm-finite-integral-domain-is-field}.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-Zn2[alpha]}
    Is the ring
    \[
        \Z_2[\alpha] = \{a+b\alpha \vert a,b\in\Z_2\}
    \]
    where $\alpha^2 = 1 + \alpha$ under regular addition and multiplication a field?
\end{exercise}

We end this section by defining factors of an element in an integral domain. These definitions will not seem useful now, but their use will become evident when the time comes.

\begin{definition}
    Let $D$ be an integral domain and $a,b \in D$. Then \term{$a$ divides $b$}\index{divides!for integral domains} (or that $a$ is a \term{factor}\index{factor!for integral domains} of $b$) if there is an element $k \in D$ such that $ak = b$. This is denoted $a \vert b$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    One sees that 2 divides 6 in $\Z$ since $2 \times 3 = 6$. Similarly 3 divides 6 since $3 \times 2 = 6$. So we may write $2 \vert 6$ and $3 \vert 6$ in $\Z$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    In $\Z_7$, we see that 3 divides 5 since $3 \times 4 = 12 = 5$. We also see that 5 divides 3 since $5 \times 2 = 10 = 3$ Thus we can write $3 \vert 5$ and $5 \vert 3$ in $\Z_7$.
\end{example}

\section{Characteristic of a Ring}
Before we introduce the characteristic of a ring, let us clarify the meaning of the order of an element in a ring.

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ be a ring and $x \in R$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \term{additive order}\index{order!additive} of $x$ is the order of $x$ in the group $(R, +)$ and is denoted $|x|_+$.
        \item If $R$ is a group with identity 1, the \term{multiplicative order}\index{order!multiplicative} of $x$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $x^n = 1$ and is denoted $|x|_\times$, if it exists.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

With an idea of the additive order and the multiplicative order of an element, we are ready to define the characteristic of a ring.

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ be a ring. We say that \term{characteristic}\index{characteristic} of $R$ is $n$ if $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that
    \[
        nr = \underbrace{r+r+\cdots+r}_{n \text{ times}} = 0
    \]
    for all $r \in R$. We then write $\Char{R} = n$. If no such $n$ exists we say $\Char{R} = 0$.
\end{definition}

We look at two properties about the characteristic.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop-characteristic-of-ring-with-identity}
    If $R$ is a ring with identity and $\Char{R} \neq 0$, then $\Char{R} = |1|_+$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\Char{R} = n$ and $|1|_+ = m$. Our goal is to show that $m = n$.

    On one hand, note that
    \[
        n1 = \underbrace{1+1+1+\cdots+1}_{n \text{ times}} = 0
    \]
    by definition of the characteristic of a ring. Note also that $m1 = \overbrace{1+1+1+\cdots+1}^{m \text{ times}} = 0$ by definition of the order of an element in the group $(R, +)$. By \myref{lemma-order-of-an-element-that-is-equivalent-to-identity}, this means that $n$ is a multiple of $m$, which thus means $m \leq n$.

    On another hand, for any $r \in R$, we know that
    \begin{align*}
        \underbrace{r + r + r + \cdots + r}_{m \text{ times}} &= r(\underbrace{1+1+1+\cdots+1}_{m \text{ times}})\\
        &= r0 & (\text{since } |1|_+ = m)\\
        &= 0.
    \end{align*}
    The minimality of the characteristic $n$ means that $m$ has to be at least $n$, i.e. $m \geq n$.

    Since $m \leq n$ and $m \geq n$, thus $m = n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-zero-or-prime-characteristic-if-integral-domain}
    If $D$ is an integral domain, then either $\Char{D} = 0$ or $\Char{D} = p$ where $p$ is a prime.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    If $\Char{D} = 0$ we are done, so assume that $\Char{D} = n \neq 0$. Furthermore assume $n = ab$ with $1 \leq a,b \leq n$.

    Note that
    \[
        0 = \underbrace{1 + 1 + \cdots + 1}_{n \text{ times}} = (\underbrace{1+1+\cdots+1}_{a \text{ times}})(\underbrace{1+1+\cdots+1}_{b \text{ times}}).
    \]
    As $D$ is an integral domain, this means that either
    \[
        \underbrace{1+1+\cdots+1}_{a \text{ times}} = 0 \text{ or } \underbrace{1+1+\cdots+1}_{b \text{ times}} = 0.
    \]
    Without loss of generality, assume that $\underbrace{1+1+\cdots+1}_{a \text{ times}} = 0$. By minimality of $\Char{D} = n$, this means that $a \geq n$. But we assumed that $a \leq n$, so we must have $a = n$. Therefore $a = n$ and $b = 1$ which is exactly what we need to show that $n$ is a prime.
\end{proof}
