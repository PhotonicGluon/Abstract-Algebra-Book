    \item We note $\inf S = \frac12$ since $1 - \frac1{2^n} > 
    \frac12$ for $n > 1$.

    We claim that $\sup S = 1$. Clearly 1 is an upper bound of $S$ since $1 - \frac1{2^n} < 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Now suppose $\epsilon > 0$. Choose $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > -\log_2\epsilon$, which means $\frac1{2^n} < \epsilon$. Then note that $1 - \frac1{2^n} \in S$ and also
    \[
        1 - \frac1{2^n} > 1 - \epsilon.
    \]
    Therefore by \myref{prop-identifying-suprema} we see that $\sup S = 1$.
