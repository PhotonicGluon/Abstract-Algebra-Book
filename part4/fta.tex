\chapter{The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}
In this final chapter, it is fitting to prove the theorem that is intertwined with classical and abstract algebra -- the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. First proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis, it unfortunately requires some results from calculus. Regardless, we will try our best to provide a complete and self-contained proof here.
