\chapter{Insolvability of the Quintic}
Classical algebra was largely dedicated to finding the solutions to polynomials. The quadratic formula solved any equation of degree 2; the cubic formula solved any degree 3 equation; the quartic formula any equation of degree 4. However, a quintic formula eluded mathematicians for countless years, until Galois finally proved that such a task was impossible.
