\chapter{Galois Theory}
Classical algebra was largely dedicated to finding the solutions to polynomials. The quadratic formula solved any equation of degree 2; the cubic formula any equation of degree 3; the quartic formula any equation of degree 4. However, a quintic formula eluded mathematicians for countless years, until Galois finally proved that such a task was impossible. In this penultimate chapter, we prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory and establish the insolvability of the quintic.
