*A Complete Introduction To Abstract Algebra* is a textbook on abstract algebra.

The exploration of such structures is fundamental to the current underpinning of scientific inquiries. For example, groups are important as they describe the symmetries which the laws of physics seem to obey. Finite fields are also used in coding theory and combinatorics. I hope this book will inspire more people to learn more about abstract algebra, beyond the simple introduction presented here.

This book serves to achieve several goals.
- Provide a step-by-step explanation of core results from abstract algebra, without ambiguity of the results discussed.
- Demystify the core steps that many textbooks gloss over when proving results or when writing the solutions to problems/exercises.
- Ensure that results from abstract algebra are as accessible, as approachable, and as understandable for as many people as possible.

I hope that this book can accomplish these goals and let readers enjoy the wonders of abstract algebra.
