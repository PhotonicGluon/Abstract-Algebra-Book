\chapter{Introduction to Rings}
In Volume I, we looked exclusively at groups and their operations. We discussed how groups are a generalisation of symmetry and looked at results related to groups. In this volume, we look at rings.

Before we introduce rings, we look at `simpler' algebraic structures and build our way up to them.

\section{Basic Algebraic Structures}
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{magma}\index{magma} is a set $M$ together with a binary operation $\ast$ which is closed. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $M$, then $a \ast b \in M$. Such a magma is denoted $(M, \ast)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider the set $M = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with the operation $\ast$ such that $(M, \ast)$ has the Cayley table as shown below.
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            $\ast$     & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} \\ \hline
            \textbf{1} & 1          & 2          & 1          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{2} & 2          & 3          & 4          & 1          \\ \hline
            \textbf{3} & 1          & 3          & 4          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{4} & 2          & 1          & 2          & 1          \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    
    Clearly for any $a, b\in M$ we have $a \ast b \in M$, so $(M, \ast)$ is a magma.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{semigroup}\index{semigroup} is a magma $(\mathcal{S}, \ast)$ where the operation $\ast$ is associative. That is, $a\ast(b\ast c) = (a\ast b)\ast c$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider the set $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with the operation $\ast$ such that $(S, \ast)$ has the Cayley table as shown below.
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            $\ast$     & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} \\ \hline
            \textbf{1} & 1          & 1          & 1          & 1          \\ \hline
            \textbf{2} & 2          & 2          & 2          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{3} & 3          & 3          & 3          & 3          \\ \hline
            \textbf{4} & 4          & 4          & 4          & 4          \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    
    One sees that $(S, \ast)$ is closed under $\ast$. In addition, $\ast$ is associative. Hence $(S, \ast)$ is a semigroup.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{monoid}\index{monoid} is a semigroup $(M, \ast)$ with an element $e$, called the \textbf{identity}, such that
    \[
        e \ast m = m \ast e = m
    \]
    for all $m \in M$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Let $X$ be a set. Let the set
    \[
        S = \{f \vert  f: X \to X\}.
    \]
    and let $\circ$ denote function composition. Then $(S, \circ)$ forms a monoid:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Closure}: If $f, g \in S$ then $f\circ g \in S$ since function composition is closed.
        \item \textbf{Associative}: Function composition is associative.
        \item \textbf{Identity}: The identity function $\id: X \to X, x\mapsto x$ is inside $S$ and
        \[
            \id \circ f = f \circ \id = f
        \]
        for all $f \in S$.
    \end{itemize}
    Thus $(S, \circ)$ forms a monoid.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{group}\index{group} is a monoid $(G, \ast)$ where every element has an inverse. That is to say, for every $g \in G$, there exists $g^{-1} \in G$ such that
    \[
        g \ast g^{-1} = g^{-1} \ast g = e
    \]
    where $e$ is the identity in $G$.
\end{definition}

\section{Definition of a Ring}
With all that setup, we are ready to define what a ring is. Note that we follow \cite[p.~223]{dummit_foote_2004}, \cite[p.~115, Definition 1.1]{hungerford_1980}, and \cite{proofwiki_ringdefinition} for the definition of a ring.
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{ring}\index{ring} is a set $R$ with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ satisfying the following axioms.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: $(R, +)$ is an abelian group.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: $(R, \cdot)$ is a semigroup.
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: $\cdot$ is distributive over $+$. That is,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (b \cdot c)$; and
            \item $(a + b) \cdot c = (a \cdot c) + (b \cdot c)$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    One may denote such a ring by $(R, +, \cdot)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Other authors (e.g. \cite[p.~136]{cohn_1982}, \cite[pp.~145--146]{clark_1984}) may require that $(R, \cdot)$ is a monoid. In this book, any ring that satisfies the above condition is called a \textbf{ring with identity}\index{ring!with identity}.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    A ring where $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a$ and $b$ in $R$ is called a \textbf{commutative ring}\index{ring!commutative}.
\end{remark}

We end this chapter by introducing the \textbf{trivial ring}.
\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{trivial ring}\index{trivial ring} (or \textbf{zero ring}\index{zero ring}), denoted $\textbf{0}$, is the ring $(\{0\}, +, \cdot)$ where
    \[
        0 + 0 = 0 \text{ and } 0 \cdot 0 = 0.    
    \]
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
    Prove that the trivial ring is a commutative ring with identity.
\end{exercise}

%=========================================
\chapter{Basics of Rings}
With basic algebraic structures and the definition of a ring out of the way, we are now ready to tackle the basics of rings in this chapter.

\section{Basic Examples of Rings}
Before we introduce some examples of rings, we make some remarks for the notation that is used in Ring Theory.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The multiplication symbol $\cdot$ is usually omitted, so $x \cdot y$ is written as $xy$.
    \item The additive identity of $R$ will always be denoted by 0 and the multiplicative identity of $R$ (if it exists) will always be denoted by 1.
    \item The additive inverse of the element $x$ will be denoted by $-x$ and the multiplicative inverse of $x$ (if it exists) will be denoted by $x^{-1}$.
    \item $n$ applications of $+$ on an element $x$ will be denoted $nx$ (and will be denoted $-nx$ if the element is $-x$), while $n$ applications of $\cdot$ on an element $x$ will be denoted $x^n$ (and will be denoted $x^{-n}$ if the element is $x^{-1}$ and if it exists).
\end{itemize}

Let's look at some examples of rings.
\begin{example}
    We show that $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$, where $\oplus_n$ and $\otimes_n$ denote addition and multiplication modulo $n$ respectively, form a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: We know $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n)$ is an abelian group from Volume I.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We can see that $(\Zn{n}, \otimes_n)$ is a semigroup as
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\Zn{n}$ is closed under $\otimes_n$ because $a \otimes_n b \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\} = \Zn{n}$; and
            \item multiplication is associative, so multiplication modulo $n$ is associative.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: It is clear that $\oplus_n$ and $\otimes_n$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$ is a ring. Furthermore, $\otimes_n$ has an identity of 1 and is commutative, so in fact $(\Zn{n}, \otimes_n)$ is a commutative monoid. Therefore $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$ is a commutative ring with identity.

    Note that, in this volume, $\Zn{n}$ refers to the ring $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    We show that $(\Q, +, \times)$, where $+$ and $\times$ denote normal addition and multiplication, form a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: From Volume I, we know that $(\Q, +)$ is an abelian group.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We note that $(\Q, \times)$ is a semigroup as
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Q$ is closed under $\times$ because multiplying two rational numbers together produce a rational number; and
            \item multiplication is associative.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: It is clear that $+$ and $\times$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Q, +, \times)$ is a ring. Furthermore, $\times$ has an identity of 1 and is commutative. So, just like $\Zn{n}$, we see that $(\Q, +, \times)$ is a commutative ring with identity.

    Note that, in this volume, $\Q$ refers to the ring $(\Q, +, \times)$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that $\Z$ is a ring under regular addition and multiplication.\newline
    (\textit{You do \textbf{not} need to prove the \textbf{Distributive} axiom.})
\end{exercise}
Note that, in this volume, $\Z$ refers to the ring $(\Z, +, \times)$.

We remark that both $\R$ and $\C$ are rings under regular addition and multiplication, although we will not prove it here.

We look at one more ring: the ring of $n \times n$ matrices.

Let $\Mn{n}{R}$ denote the set of $n\times n$ matrices with entries in the ring $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define \textbf{matrix addition}\index{matrix addition} within this set. Suppose we have $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$, and let their sum be $\textbf{C} = \textbf{A} + \textbf{B}$. Then
    \[
        c_{i,j} = a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}    
    \]
    where $\oplus$ is the addition operation in the ring $R$.
    
    \item We define \textbf{matrix multiplication}\index{matrix multiplication} within this set. Suppose $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$, and let their product be $\textbf{C} = \textbf{AB}$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        c_{i,j} &= (a_{i,1}\otimes b_{1,j}) \oplus (a_{i,2}\otimes b_{2,j}) \oplus \cdots \oplus (a_{i,n}\otimes b_{n,j})\\
        &= \sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k}\otimes b_{i,k})
    \end{align*}
    where $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ are the addition and multiplication operations in the ring $R$ respectively.
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}
    $\Mn{n}{R}$ is a ring under matrix addition and matrix multiplication.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We need to prove that the ring axioms hold.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: We first prove that $(\Mn{n}{R}, +)$ is indeed an abelian group.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Closure}: Clearly the sum of any two matrices in $\Mn{n}{R}$ is also a square matrix with $n$ rows with elements inside $R$, meaning that $\Mn{n}{R}$ is closed under matrix addition.

            \item \textbf{Associative}: Let the matrices $\textbf{A}$, $\textbf{B}$, and $\textbf{C}$ belong inside $\Mn{n}{R}$. Let $\textbf{P} = \textbf{A} + (\textbf{B} + \textbf{C})$ and $\textbf{Q} = (\textbf{A} + \textbf{B}) + \textbf{C}$. We note that $\textbf{P} = \textbf{Q}$ as
            \begin{align*}
                p_{i,j} &= a_{i,j} \oplus (b_{i,j} \oplus c_{i,j})\\
                &= (a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}) \oplus c_{i,j} & (\oplus\text{ is associative})\\
                &= q_{i,j}
            \end{align*}
            which proves that matrix addition is associative.
    
            \item \textbf{Identity}: Denote the $n \times n$ matrix with contains only the zero in $R$ by $\textbf{0}_n$. One sees clearly that this is the identity in $\Mn{n}{R}$ as $\textbf{M} + \textbf{0}_n = \textbf{M}$ for any matrix in $\Mn{n}{R}$.
            
            \item \textbf{Inverse}: Let $\textbf{A} \in \Mn{n}{R}$. Define the matrix $\textbf{B} = -\textbf{A}$ where
            \[
                b_{i,j} = -a_{i,j},    
            \]
            that is, $b_{i,j}$ contains the additive inverse of $a_{i,j}$ in the ring $R$. Then one sees that $\textbf{A} + \textbf{B} = \textbf{0}_n$.\newline
            (Note that we denote the additive inverse of a matrix $\textbf{M}$ by $-\textbf{M}$.)

            \item \textbf{Commutative}: Let $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$. Set $\textbf{C} = \textbf{A} + \textbf{B}$ and $\textbf{D} = \textbf{B} + \textbf{C}$. Then
            \begin{align*}
                c_{i,j} &= a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}\\
                &= b_{i,j} \oplus a_{i,j} & (\oplus \text{ is commutative})\\
                &= d_{i,j}
            \end{align*}
            which means $\textbf{C} = \textbf{D}$.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We now need to prove that $(\Mn{n}{R}, \cdot)$ is a semigroup.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Closure}: In Volume I we showed that matrix multiplication produces another $n \times n$ matrix. Furthermore the entries of the new matrix are elements of $R$. Hence $\Mn{n}{R}$ is closed under matrix multiplication.
        
            \item \textbf{Associative}: We proved matrix multiplication is associative in Volume I.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: We prove only $\textbf{A}(\textbf{B} + \textbf{C}) = (\textbf{AB}) + (\textbf{AC})$ as the other case is proven similarly.
        
        Let $\textbf{R} = \textbf{A}(\textbf{B} + \textbf{C})$, $\textbf{G} = \textbf{AB}$, and $\textbf{H} = \textbf{AC}$. We note
        \begin{align*}
            r_{i,j} &= \sum_{k=1}^n \left(a_{i,k} \otimes \left(b_{k,j} \oplus c_{k,j}\right)\right)\\
            &= \sum_{k=1}^n \left((a_{i,k} \otimes b_{k,j}) \oplus (a_{i,k} \otimes c_{k,j})\right)\\
            &= \left(\sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k} \otimes b_{k,j})\right) \oplus \left(\sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k} \otimes c_{k,j})\right)\\
            &= g_{i,j}\oplus h_{i,j}
        \end{align*}
        which means $\textbf{R} = \textbf{G} + \textbf{H}$.
    \end{itemize}
    As all the ring axioms are satisfied, thus $\Mn{n}{R}$ is a ring.
\end{proof}
For brevity, we let $\Mn{n}{R}$ denote the ring under matrix addition and multiplication.

\section{General Properties of Rings}
We list some properties of rings here. For each of the propositions, assume $R$ is a ring.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-multiplying-by-zero-is-zero}
    $0x = x0 = 0$ for all $x \in R$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We note that
    \begin{align*}
        0x &= (0 + 0)x & (0 \text{ is additive inverse})\\
        &= 0x + 0x & (\text{by \textbf{Distributive} axiom})
    \end{align*}
    so by `subtracting' $0x$ on both sides (i.e., adding $-0x$ on both sides) we see $0 = 0x$. A similar argument shows that $x0 = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-product-of-element-and-additive-inverse-is-additive-inverse-of-product}
    $(-a)b = a(-b) = -(ab)$ for any $a$ and $b$ in $R$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We show that $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $a(-b) = -(ab)$ to complete the proof.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note $(-a)b + ab = (-a + a)b = 0b = 0$ by \textbf{Distributive} axiom. Hence by subtracting $ab$ on both sides we see $(-a)b = -(ab)$.
        \item Note also $a(-b) + ab = a(-b + b) = a0 = 0$ by \textbf{Distributive} axiom. Hence by subtracting $ab$ on both sides we see $a(-b) = -(ab)$.
    \end{itemize}
    Result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    $(-a)(-b) = ab$ for any $a$ and $b$ in $R$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    See \myref{exercise-product-of-additive-inverses} (later).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    If $R$ has an identity, it is unique.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose 1 and $1'$ are identities, and consider the sum $1 + 1'$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        1 + 1' &= 1'(1+1') & (\text{multiplying by identity }1')\\
        &= 1'1 + 1'1' & (\text{by \textbf{Distributive} axiom})\\
        &= 1' + 1'. & (1 \text{ and } 1' \text{ are identities})
    \end{align*}
    Subtracting $1'$ on both sides yields $1 = 1'$, meaning that the identity is unique.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-product-of-additive-inverses}
    Show that $(-a)(-b) = ab$ for any $a$ and $b$ in $R$.
\end{exercise}

\section{More Definitions}
Suppose $R$ is a ring.
\begin{definition}
    We say that $a \neq 0$ is a \textbf{zero divisor}\index{zero divisor} if there exists $b \neq 0$ such that $ab = 0$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider the ring $\Zn{12}$. Clearly 4 and 6 are in $\Zn{12}$, and their product is $24 = 2 \times 12 = 0$ in $\Zn{12}$. Hence 4 and 6 are zero divisors in $\Zn{12}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    We claim that the ring
    \[
        R = \{f: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]\}
    \]
    has zero divisors. Consider the functions
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= x\\
        g(x) &= \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{ if } x \neq 0\\
            1 & \text{ if } x = 0
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Clearly neither of them are the zero function. However, consider $f(x)g(x)$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $x \neq 0$, then $g(x) = 0$ which means $f(x)g(x) = 0$.
        \item If $x = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ which means $f(x)g(x) = 0$.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence their product is the zero function, meaning that $R$ has zero divisors $f$ and $g$.
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}
    Does the ring $\Mn{2}{\mathbb{R}}$ have zero divisors?
\end{exercise}
We note one property about zero divisors, which will be used in future chapters.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop-zero-divisors-have-no-inverses}
    Zero divisors do not have inverses.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Assume $a \neq 0$ is a zero divisor in the ring $R$. That means that there exists a $b \neq 0$ in $R$ such that $ab = 0$. Seeking a contradiction, assume $a$ has an inverse. Then we must have
    \[
        b = (a^{-1}a)b = a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1}0 = 0    
    \]
    which contradicts $b \neq 0$. Hence a zero divisor has no inverse.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Suppose $0 \neq 1$. An element $u \in R$ is called a \textbf{unit}\index{unit} if there exists a $v \in R$ such that $uv=vu=1$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Equivalently, we say that $u$ is a unit if it has a multiplicative inverse.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
    3 and 7 are units in $\Zn{10}$ since $3 \times 7 = 7 \times 3 = 21 = 1$ in $\Zn{10}$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    If every non-zero element $x \in R$ is a unit, then $R$ is said to be a \textbf{division ring}\index{division ring}.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    One observes trivially that since every element is a unit in a division ring, therefore a division ring is a ring with identity.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    A commutative division ring is called a \textbf{field}\index{field}.
\end{definition}
We look at fields in more detail in Volume III.

\section{Subrings}
We end this chapter off with an exploration about subrings.

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ be a ring and $S$ be a subset of $R$. Then $S$ is a \textbf{subring}\index{subring} of $R$ if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(S, +) \leq (R, +)$, i.e. the set $S$ under addition is a subgroup of $R$ under addition; and
        \item For all $a$ and $b$ in $S$ we have $ab \in S$, i.e. $S$ is closed under multiplication.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Alternatively, one may show that $S$ is a ring to prove that $S$ is a subring of $R$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    We know that $\Z$ and $\Q$ are rings, and clearly $\Z \subseteq \Q$. Hence $\Z$ is a subring of $\Q$. Similarly, $\Q$ is a subring of $\R$, and $\R$ is a subring of $\C$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Consider the \textbf{gaussian integers}\index{gaussian integers},
    \[
        \Z[i] = \{a + bi \vert a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\},
    \]
    where $i$ is the imaginary unit (i.e., $i^2 = -1$). We will show that $\Z[i]$ is a subring of $\C$.
    \begin{proof}
        Clearly $\Z[i] \subseteq \C$. We show that $(\Z[i], +) \leq (\C, +)$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clearly the identity of $(\C, +)$, which is 0, is inside $(\Z[i], +)$ as $0 = 0 + 0i$.
            \item For any $a + bi, c+di \in \Z[i]$, we have $(a+bi) + (-(c+di)) = (a-c) + (b-d)i \in \Z[i]$.
        \end{itemize}
        Therefore by subgroup test we see $(\Z[i], +) \leq (\C, +)$.

        Now we show that $\Z[i]$ is closed under multiplication. Let $a + bi, c+di \in \Z[i]$. Then their product is
        \begin{align*}
            (a+bi)(c+di) &= ac+adi+bci+bdi^2\\
            &= (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i
            &\in \Z[i]
        \end{align*}
        so $\Z[i]$ is closed under multiplication. Therefore $\Z[i]$ is a subring of $\C$.
    \end{proof}
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}
    Show that
    \[
        R = \left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&a\\a&a\end{pmatrix} \vert a \in \R\right\}
    \]
    is a subring of $\Mn{2}{\mathbb{R}}$.
\end{exercise}

\chapter{Integral Domains}
We explored the absolute basics of rings in the previous chapter. When working in abstract algebra, we usually prefer rings with slightly more structure as they allow us to generate more useful and applicable results. Integral domains are an important category of rings, which we explore in this chapter.

\section{Definition and Examples}
\begin{definition}
    An \textbf{integral domain}\index{integral domain} is a commutative ring with identity and no zero divisors.
\end{definition}
Recall that an element $a \neq 0$ is a zero divisor if there exists a $b \neq 0$ such that $ab = 0$. What we mean is that an integral domain has no such element.

\begin{example}
    We show that the ring $\Z$ is an integral domain. We note that $\Z$ is a commutative ring as multiplication is commutative. Furthermore, clearly 1 is the multiplicative identity in $\Z$. All that remains is to show that there does not exist any zero divisors.

    Suppose $a$ and $b$ are non-zero elements in $\Z$. We show that $ab \neq 0$ to prove that there does not exist any zero divisors. Let's first consider the case when $b > 0$. Then we may write
    \[
        ab = \underbrace{a + a + \cdots + a}_{b \text{ times}}
    \]
    which clearly is not zero since $a \neq 0$. Now if $b < 0$ then note
    \[
        ab = (-a)(-b) = \underbrace{(-a) + (-a) + \cdots + (-a)}_{(-b) \text{times}}
    \]
    which is also not zero as $-a \neq 0$. Hence there are no zero divisors in $\Z$.

    Therefore $\Z$ is an integral domain.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    We show that the ring $\Z[i]$, the gaussian integers, is an integral domain. Similar to $\Z$, we note multiplication is commutative with identity 1.

    Suppose $w$ and $z$ are non-zero elements in $\Z[i]$; write $w = a+bi$ and $z = c+di$. Note that $a^2+b^2 \neq 0$ and $c^2 + d^2 \neq 0$. Now clearly
    \[
        wz = (a+bi)(c+di) = ac+adi+bci+bdi^2 = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i
    \]
    and
    \begin{align*}
        (ac-bd)^2 + (ad+bc)^2 &= (a^2c^2 - 2abcd + b^2d^2) +\\
        &\quad(a^2d^2 + 2abcd + b^2c^2)\\
        &= a^2c^2 + a^2d^2 + b^2c^2 + b^2d^2\\
        &= (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2)\\
        &\neq 0
    \end{align*}
    which hence means that $wz \neq 0$. Therefore $\Z[i]$ has no zero divisors, thereby meaning that $\Z[i]$ is indeed an integral domain.
\end{example}

We note an interesting result regarding fields here.
\begin{proposition}
    Any field is an integral domain.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Any non-zero element in a field is a unit, i.e. has an inverse. Now by \myref{prop-zero-divisors-have-no-inverses}, any zero divisor must not have an inverse; the converse being that any element that has an inverse cannot be a zero divisor. Hence, there are no zero divisors in a field. Now a field is commutative, therefore meaning that the field is an integral domain.
\end{proof}

Let's look at some non-examples of fields.
\begin{example}
    The ring $\Mn{n}{R}$ where $R$ is any ring is not an integral domain since $\Mn{n}{R}$ is not commutative.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    The ring $2\Z$ is not an integral domain as it does not contain a multiplicative identity (namely, 1).
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    The ring $\Z \times \Z$ under pairwise addition and multiplication is not an integral domain as $(0,1) \neq (0, 0)$ and $(1, 0) \neq (0, 0)$ but $(0,1)(1,0) = (0, 0)$, meaning that $\Z \times \Z$ contains a zero divisor.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that the ring
    \[
        \Z[\sqrt2] = \left\{a + b\sqrt2 \vert a,b \in \Z\right\}
    \]
    is an integral domain.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
    Explain why all $\Zn{n}$ where $n$ is a positive composite number are not integral domains.
\end{exercise}

\section{Introduction to Rings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We note the following.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: $(\{0\}, +)$ is an abelian group by Volume I.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: $(\{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group by Volume I.
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: We know $+$ and $\cdot$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\{0\}, +, \cdot)$ is a commutative ring with identity.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Basics of Rings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We note the following.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: $(\Z, +)$ is an abelian group by Volume I.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: $(\Z, \times)$ is a semigroup since
        \begin{itemize}
            \item multiplying two integers always results in an integer, so $\Z$ is closed under $\times$; and
            \item $\times$ is associative.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: We know $+$ and $\times$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Z, +, \times)$ is a ring.

    \item Consider $(-a)(-b) + (-ab)$ and note
    \begin{align*}
        &(-a)(-b) + (-ab)\\
        &= (-a)(-b) + (-a)b & (\text{\myref{prop-product-of-element-and-additive-inverse-is-additive-inverse-of-product}})\\
        &= (-a)(-b + b) & (\text{by \textbf{Distributive} axiom})\\
        &= (-a)0\\
        &= 0 & (\myref{prop-multiplying-by-zero-is-zero})
    \end{align*}
    which means $(-a)(-b) = -(-ab) = ab$ as required.

    \item The ring $\Mn{2}{\mathbb{R}}$ indeed has zero divisors, as $\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix} \neq \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$ but $\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$ which means that $\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$ is a zero divisor.
    
    \item We first show that $(R, +) \leq (\Mn{2}{\R}, +)$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clearly the identity of $(\Mn{2}{\R}, +)$, the zero matrix $\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$, is inside $R$.
        \item Consider $\begin{pmatrix}a&a\\a&a\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}b&b\\b&b\end{pmatrix} \in R$. The additive inverse of $\begin{pmatrix}b&b\\b&b\end{pmatrix}$ is $\begin{pmatrix}-b&-b\\-b&-b\end{pmatrix}$, and so their sum is
        \[
            \begin{pmatrix}a&a\\a&a\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}-b&-b\\-b&-b\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}a-b&a-b\\a-b&a-b\end{pmatrix} \in R
        \]
        which means $R$ is closed under addition.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(R, +) \leq (\Mn{2}{\R}, +)$ by subgroup test.

    We now show that $R$ is closed under multiplication. Some calculation yields that
    \[
        \begin{pmatrix}a&a\\a&a\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}b&b\\b&b\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}2ab&2ab\\2ab&2ab\end{pmatrix}
    \]
    which is clearly in $R$. Therefore $R$ is a subring of $\Mn{2}{\R}$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Integral Domains}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clearly multiplication is commutative and $1 = 1 + 0\sqrt2 \in \Z[\sqrt2]$. All that is needed is to show that there are no zero divisors in $\Z[\sqrt2]$.
    
    Take $a+b\sqrt2, c+d\sqrt2 \in \Z[\sqrt2]$ such that $a+b\sqrt2 \neq 0$ and $(a+b\sqrt2)(c+d\sqrt2) = 0$. We want to show that the only way this is possible is if $c = d = 0$. Now consider
    \[
        \left((a+b\sqrt2)\underbrace{(a-b\sqrt2)}_{\neq 0}\right)\left((c+d\sqrt2)\underbrace{(c-d\sqrt2)}_{\neq 0}\right) = 0.
    \]
    This simplifies to $(a^2-2b^2)(c^2-2d^2) = 0$. Hence either $a^2-2b^2 = 0$ or $c^2-2d^2 = 0$, implying $a = \sqrt2b$ or $c = \sqrt2d$. Now we cannot have $a = \sqrt2b$ as $\sqrt2$ is not an integer; the only case that is possible is if $c = \sqrt2d$ which finally means that $c = d = 0$.

    \item Let $n = ab$ where $a,b \in Z$ and, without loss of generality, assume $1 < a \leq b < n$ (we exclude 1 and $n$ because we want $a$ and $b$ to be `proper' factors). Now clearly $a, b \in \Zn{n}$ with them both being non-zero but $ab = n = 0$ in $\Zn{n}$. Hence $a$ and $b$ are zero divisors in $\Zn{n}$, meaning $\Zn{n}$ is not an integral domain.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction to Rings}
No problems.

\section{Basics of Rings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Since $u$ is a unit, thus $u^{-1}$ exists. Consider the element $(-u)(-u^{-1})$. We know from an earlier proposition that this equals $uu^{-1} = 1$. Similarly, $(-u^{-1})(-u) = 1$. Hence $-u$ is a unit.

    \item Suppose $R$ is a ring where 0 = 1, and let $x \in R$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        x &= 1x & (1 \text{ is the multiplicative identity})\\
        &= 0x & (0 = 1)\\
        &= 0 & (0x = 0 \text{ for all }x)
    \end{align*}
    which means that $R$ only contains one element, namely the identity 0. Hence the trivial ring is the unique ring where 0 = 1.

    \item Since $(R, \ast, \ast)$ is a ring, we know that $(R, \ast)$ is an abelian group and that $a \ast(b\ast c) = (a \ast b) \ast (a \ast c)$ for all $a, b, c \in R$ (left distribution). Consider an element $x \in R$. Thus we must have
    \[
        x \ast (x \ast x) = (x \ast x) \ast (x \ast x)    
    \]
    which means $x^3 = x^4$. Since $(R, \ast)$ is a group, thus $x^{-3}$ exists. Applying that on both sides means $x = e$ where $e$ is the identity. Therefore, $R$ contains only one element, the identity, which means that $(R, \ast, \ast)$ is actually the trivial ring.

    \item By way of contradiction assume that the element $x$ is both a zero divisor and a unit. Since $x$ is a zero divisor, we know $x \neq 0$ and there exists a non-zero $y \in R$ such that $xy = 0$. Since $x$ is a unit, thus $x^{-1}$ exists such that $xx^{-1} = x^{-1}x = 1$. However we note that
    \begin{align*}
        y &= (x^{-1}x)y & (\text{as }x^{-1}x = 1)\\
        &= x^{-1}(xy) & (\text{associativity})\\
        &= x^{-1}0 & (\text{as }x \text{ is a zero divisor})\\
        &= 0
    \end{align*}
    which contradicts the fact that $y \neq 0$. Therefore it is impossible for an element to be both a zero divisor and a unit.

    \item For brevity let $R = \Q[\sqrt2]$. We first show that $(R,+)$ is an abelian group.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Closure}: Take $a+b\sqrt2, c+d\sqrt2 \in R$. Clearly
        \[
            (a+b\sqrt2) + (c+d\sqrt2) = (a+c) + (b+d)\sqrt2 \in R
        \]
        which means that $R$ is closed under addition.
        \item \textbf{Associativity}: + is associative.
        \item \textbf{Identity}: The identity is $0 = 0 + 0\sqrt2$.
        \item \textbf{Inverse}: The inverse of $a+b\sqrt2 \in R$ is $(-a) + (-b)\sqrt2$ which is in $R$.
        \item \textbf{Commutative}: + is commutative.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(R, +)$ is an abelian group.

    Now we show that $(R, \cdot)$ is a semigroup.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Closure}: Take $a+b\sqrt2, c+d\sqrt2 \in R$. Then
        \begin{align*}
            (a+b\sqrt2)(c+d\sqrt2) &= ac + ad\sqrt2 + bc\sqrt2 + 2bd\\
            &= (ac+2bd) + (ad+bc)\sqrt2\\
            &\in R.
        \end{align*}
        \item \textbf{Associative}: $\cdot$ is associative.
    \end{itemize}
    So $(R, \cdot)$ is an abelian group.

    Clearly $+$ and $\cdot$ distribute, so we have shown that $R$ is in fact a ring.

    Furthermore,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\cdot$ is commutative, meaning that $R$ is a commutative ring;
        \item $1 = 1 + 0\sqrt2 \in R$ is the multiplicative identity, so $R$ is a ring with identity; and
        \item for any non-zero element $a+b\sqrt2$ we have its multiplicative inverse as
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{1}{a+b\sqrt2} &= \frac{a-b\sqrt2}{(a-b\sqrt2)(a+b\sqrt2)}\\
            &= \frac{a-b\sqrt2}{a^2-2b}\\
            &= \frac{a}{a^2-2b} + \left(-\frac{b}{a^2-2b}\right)\sqrt2\\
            &\in R.
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    Therefore $R$ is a field.

    \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Suppose $R$ has an identity $E = \begin{pmatrix}e_1&e_2\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$. Take any matrix $M = \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\0&0\end{pmatrix} \in R$, so we must have $ME = EM = M$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Note $EM = \begin{pmatrix}e_1&e_2\\0&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\0&0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}e_1a&e_1b\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$.
            \item Also, $ME = \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\0&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}e_1&e_2\\0&0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}ae_1&ae_2\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$.
        \end{itemize}
        Now as $EM = M$ we must have $e_1 = 1$. But as $ME = M$ this means that
        \[
            \begin{pmatrix}a&ae_2\\0&0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\0&0\end{pmatrix}
        \]
        which implies that $ae_2 = b$, hence meaning $e_2 = \frac{b}{a}$ which is not a constant. Hence there does not exist a fixed identity $E$ in $R$.

        \item Consider the subset
        \[
            S = \left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix} \vert a \in \R\right\}
        \]
        of $R$. We first show that $S$ is a subring of $R$. Clearly $(S, +) \leq (R, +)$ so we only show that $S$ is closed under matrix multiplication.
        \[
            \begin{pmatrix}a&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}b&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}ab&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix} \in S.
        \]

        One sees clearly based on the above calculation that $\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$ is the identity in $S$. Hence $S$ is a subring of $R$ with identity.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Consider $(r+r)^2$. CLearly $(r+r)^2 = r+r$ by definition of a Boolean ring. On the other hand, one may expand $(r+r)^2$ to yield
        \begin{align*}
            (r+r)^2 &= r^2 + r^2 + r^2 + r^2 \\
            &= r + r + r + r & (r^2 = r \text{ for all }r \in R)
        \end{align*}
        which means $r+r = r+r+r+r$. Thus $r+r = 0$ which hence means $r=-r$.

        \item Let $x,y\in R$. Then
        \begin{align*}
            x+y &= (x+y)^2 & (r = r^2 \text{ for all }r \in R)\\
            &= x^2 + xy + yx + y^2\\
            &= x + xy + yx + y. & (r = r^2 \text{ for all }r \in R)
        \end{align*}
        Subtracting $x+y$ on both sides yields $xy +yx = 0$. Hence $xy = -yx$ which means $xy = yx$ by (i). Therefore every Boolean ring is commutative.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Let $u$ and $v$ be units, meaning that $u^{-1}$ and $v^{-1}$ exist. Then one sees that $(uv)(v^{-1}u^{-1}) = (v^{-1}u^{-1})(uv) = 1$, which means that $uv$ is also a unit.
        
        \item Let $n$ be a positive integer such that $x^n = 0$. Then
        \begin{align*}
            (ux)^n &= u^nx^n & (R\text{ is commutative})\\
            &= u^n0 & (x \text{ is nilpotent})\\
            &= 0
        \end{align*}
        which means that $ux$ is also nilpotent.

        \item One sees that $1-x$ is a unit as
        \[
            (1-x)(1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots+x^{n-1}) = 1.    
        \]
        Now we write
        \begin{align*}
            u-x &= u(1-xu^{-1}) & (u \text{ is a unit})\\
            &= u(1-u^{-1}x). & (R \text{ is commutative})
        \end{align*}
        Note that $u^{-1}$ is a unit, so by (ii) we know that $u^{-1}x$ is nilpotent. By the above argument this means that $1-u^{-1}x$ is a unit. Finally, since both $u$ and $1-u^{-1}x$ are units, this means that $u-x = u(1-u^{-1}x)$ is a unit by (i).
