\chapter{Introduction to Rings}
In Volume I, we looked exclusively at groups and their operations. We discussed how groups are a generalisation of symmetry and looked at results related to groups. In this volume, we look at rings.

Before we introduce rings, we look at `simpler' algebraic structures and build our way up to them.

\section{Basic Algebraic Structures}
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{magma}\index{magma} is a set $M$ together with a binary operation $\ast$ which is closed. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $M$, then $a \ast b \in M$. Such a magma is denoted $(M, \ast)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider the set $M = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with the operation $\ast$ such that $(M, \ast)$ has the Cayley table as shown below.
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            $\ast$     & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} \\ \hline
            \textbf{1} & 1          & 2          & 1          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{2} & 2          & 3          & 4          & 1          \\ \hline
            \textbf{3} & 1          & 3          & 4          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{4} & 2          & 1          & 2          & 1          \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    
    Clearly for any $a, b\in M$ we have $a \ast b \in M$, so $(M, \ast)$ is a magma.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{semigroup}\index{semigroup} is a magma $(\mathcal{S}, \ast)$ where the operation $\ast$ is associative. That is, $a\ast(b\ast c) = (a\ast b)\ast c$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider the set $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with the operation $\ast$ such that $(S, \ast)$ has the Cayley table as shown below.
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            $\ast$     & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} \\ \hline
            \textbf{1} & 1          & 1          & 1          & 1          \\ \hline
            \textbf{2} & 2          & 2          & 2          & 2          \\ \hline
            \textbf{3} & 3          & 3          & 3          & 3          \\ \hline
            \textbf{4} & 4          & 4          & 4          & 4          \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    
    One sees that $(S, \ast)$ is closed under $\ast$. In addition, $\ast$ is associative. Hence $(S, \ast)$ is a semigroup.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{monoid}\index{monoid} is a semigroup $(M, \ast)$ with an element $e$, called the \textbf{identity}, such that
    \[
        e \ast m = m \ast e = m
    \]
    for all $m \in M$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Let $X$ be a set. Let the set
    \[
        S = \{f \vert  f: X \to X\}.
    \]
    and let $\circ$ denote function composition. Then $(S, \circ)$ forms a monoid:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Closure}: If $f, g \in S$ then $f\circ g \in S$ since function composition is closed.
        \item \textbf{Associative}: Function composition is associative.
        \item \textbf{Identity}: The identity function $\id: X \to X, x\mapsto x$ is inside $S$ and
        \[
            \id \circ f = f \circ \id = f
        \]
        for all $f \in S$.
    \end{itemize}
    Thus $(S, \circ)$ forms a monoid.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{group}\index{group} is a monoid $(G, \ast)$ where every element has an inverse. That is to say, for every $g \in G$, there exists $g^{-1} \in G$ such that
    \[
        g \ast g^{-1} = g^{-1} \ast g = e
    \]
    where $e$ is the identity in $G$.
\end{definition}

\section{Definition of a Ring}
With all that setup, we are ready to define what a ring is. Note that we follow \cite[p.~223]{dummit_foote_2004}, \cite[p.~115, Definition 1.1]{hungerford_1980}, and \cite{proofwiki_ringdefinition} for the definition of a ring.
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{ring}\index{ring} is a set $R$ with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ satisfying the following axioms.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: $(R, +)$ is an abelian group.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: $(R, \cdot)$ is a semigroup.
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: $\cdot$ is distributive over $+$. That is,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (b \cdot c)$; and
            \item $(a + b) \cdot c = (a \cdot c) + (b \cdot c)$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    One may denote such a ring by $(R, +, \cdot)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Other authors (e.g. \cite[p.~136]{cohn_1982}, \cite[pp.~145--146]{clark_1984}) may require that $(R, \cdot)$ is a monoid. In this book, any ring that satisfies the above condition is called a \textbf{ring with identity}\index{ring!with identity}.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    A ring where $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a$ and $b$ in $R$ is called a \textbf{commutative ring}\index{ring!commutative}.
\end{remark}

We end this chapter by introducing the \textbf{trivial ring}.
\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{trivial ring}\index{trivial ring} (or \textbf{zero ring}\index{zero ring}), denoted $\textbf{0}$, is the ring $(\{0\}, +, \cdot)$ where
    \[
        0 + 0 = 0 \text{ and } 0 \cdot 0 = 0.    
    \]
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
    Prove that the trivial ring is a commutative ring with identity.
\end{exercise}

%=========================================
\chapter{Basics of Rings}
With basic algebraic structures and the definition of a ring out of the way, we are now ready to tackle the basics of rings in this chapter.

\section{Basic Examples of Rings}
Before we introduce some examples of rings, we make some remarks for the notation that is used in Ring Theory.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The multiplication symbol $\cdot$ is usually omitted, so $x \cdot y$ is written as $xy$.
    \item The additive identity of $R$ will always be denoted by 0 and the multiplicative identity of $R$ (if it exists) will always be denoted by 1.
    \item The additive inverse of the element $x$ will be denoted by $-x$ and the multiplicative inverse of $x$ (if it exists) will be denoted by $x^{-1}$.
    \item $n$ applications of $+$ on an element $x$ will be denoted $nx$ (and will be denoted $-nx$ if the element is $-x$), while $n$ applications of $\cdot$ on an element $x$ will be denoted $x^n$ (and will be denoted $x^{-n}$ if the element is $x^{-1}$ and if it exists).
\end{itemize}

Let's look at some examples of rings.
\begin{example}
    We show that $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$, where $\oplus_n$ and $\otimes_n$ denote addition and multiplication modulo $n$ respectively, form a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: We know $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n)$ is an abelian group from Volume I.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We can see that $(\Zn{n}, \otimes_n)$ is a semigroup as
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\Zn{n}$ is closed under $\otimes_n$ because $a \otimes_n b \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\} = \Zn{n}$; and
            \item multiplication is associative, so multiplication modulo $n$ is associative.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: It is clear that $\oplus_n$ and $\otimes_n$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$ is a ring. Furthermore, $\otimes_n$ has an identity of 1 and is commutative, so in fact $(\Zn{n}, \otimes_n)$ is a commutative monoid. Therefore $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$ is a commutative ring with identity.

    Note that, in this volume, $\Zn{n}$ refers to the ring $(\Zn{n}, \oplus_n, \otimes_n)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    We show that $(\Q, +, \times)$, where $+$ and $\times$ denote normal addition and multiplication, form a ring.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: From Volume I, we know that $(\Q, +)$ is an abelian group.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We note that $(\Q, \times)$ is a semigroup as
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Q$ is closed under $\times$ because multiplying two rational numbers together produce a rational number; and
            \item multiplication is associative.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: It is clear that $+$ and $\times$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Q, +, \times)$ is a ring. Furthermore, $\times$ has an identity of 1 and is commutative. So, just like $\Zn{n}$, we see that $(\Q, +, \times)$ is a commutative ring with identity.

    Note that, in this volume, $\Q$ refers to the ring $(\Q, +, \times)$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Prove that $\Z$ is a ring under regular addition and multiplication.\newline
    (\textit{You do \textbf{not} need to prove the \textbf{Distributive} axiom.})
\end{exercise}
Note that, in this volume, $\Z$ refers to the ring $(\Z, +, \times)$.

We remark that both $\R$ and $\C$ are rings under regular addition and multiplication, although we will not prove it here.

We look at one more ring: the ring of $n \times n$ matrices.

Let $\Mn{n}{R}$ denote the set of $n\times n$ matrices with entries in the ring $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define \textbf{matrix addition}\index{matrix addition} within this set. Suppose we have $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$, and let their sum be $\textbf{C} = \textbf{A} + \textbf{B}$. Then
    \[
        c_{i,j} = a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}    
    \]
    where $\oplus$ is the addition operation in the ring $R$.
    
    \item We define \textbf{matrix multiplication}\index{matrix multiplication} within this set. Suppose $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$, and let their product be $\textbf{C} = \textbf{AB}$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        c_{i,j} &= (a_{i,1}\otimes b_{1,j}) \oplus (a_{i,2}\otimes b_{2,j}) \oplus \cdots \oplus (a_{i,n}\otimes b_{n,j})\\
        &= \sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k}\otimes b_{i,k})
    \end{align*}
    where $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ are the addition and multiplication operations in the ring $R$ respectively.
\end{itemize}

\begin{proposition}
    $\Mn{n}{R}$ is a ring under matrix addition and matrix multiplication.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We need to prove that the ring axioms hold.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: We first prove that $(\Mn{n}{R}, +)$ is indeed an abelian group.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Closure}: Clearly the sum of any two matrices in $\Mn{n}{R}$ is also a square matrix with $n$ rows with elements inside $R$, meaning that $\Mn{n}{R}$ is closed under matrix addition.

            \item \textbf{Associative}: Let the matrices $\textbf{A}$, $\textbf{B}$, and $\textbf{C}$ belong inside $\Mn{n}{R}$. Let $\textbf{P} = \textbf{A} + (\textbf{B} + \textbf{C})$ and $\textbf{Q} = (\textbf{A} + \textbf{B}) + \textbf{C}$. We note that $\textbf{P} = \textbf{Q}$ as
            \begin{align*}
                p_{i,j} &= a_{i,j} \oplus (b_{i,j} \oplus c_{i,j})\\
                &= (a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}) \oplus c_{i,j} & (\oplus\text{ is associative})\\
                &= q_{i,j}
            \end{align*}
            which proves that matrix addition is associative.
    
            \item \textbf{Identity}: Denote the $n \times n$ matrix with contains only the zero in $R$ by $\textbf{0}_n$. One sees clearly that this is the identity in $\Mn{n}{R}$ as $\textbf{M} + \textbf{0}_n = \textbf{M}$ for any matrix in $\Mn{n}{R}$.
            
            \item \textbf{Inverse}: Let $\textbf{A} \in \Mn{n}{R}$. Define the matrix $\textbf{B} = -\textbf{A}$ where
            \[
                b_{i,j} = -a_{i,j},    
            \]
            that is, $b_{i,j}$ contains the additive inverse of $a_{i,j}$ in the ring $R$. Then one sees that $\textbf{A} + \textbf{B} = \textbf{0}_n$.\newline
            (Note that we denote the additive inverse of a matrix $\textbf{M}$ by $-\textbf{M}$.)

            \item \textbf{Commutative}: Let $\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} \in \Mn{n}{R}$. Set $\textbf{C} = \textbf{A} + \textbf{B}$ and $\textbf{D} = \textbf{B} + \textbf{C}$. Then
            \begin{align*}
                c_{i,j} &= a_{i,j} \oplus b_{i,j}\\
                &= b_{i,j} \oplus a_{i,j} & (\oplus \text{ is commutative})\\
                &= d_{i,j}
            \end{align*}
            which means $\textbf{C} = \textbf{D}$.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: We now need to prove that $(\Mn{n}{R}, \cdot)$ is a semigroup.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Closure}: In Volume I we showed that matrix multiplication produces another $n \times n$ matrix. Furthermore the entries of the new matrix are elements of $R$. Hence $\Mn{n}{R}$ is closed under matrix multiplication.
        
            \item \textbf{Associative}: We proved matrix multiplication is associative in Volume I.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: We prove only $\textbf{A}(\textbf{B} + \textbf{C}) = (\textbf{AB}) + (\textbf{AC})$ as the other case is proven similarly.
        
        Let $\textbf{R} = \textbf{A}(\textbf{B} + \textbf{C})$, $\textbf{G} = \textbf{AB}$, and $\textbf{H} = \textbf{AC}$. We note
        \begin{align*}
            r_{i,j} &= \sum_{k=1}^n \left(a_{i,k} \otimes \left(b_{k,j} \oplus c_{k,j}\right)\right)\\
            &= \sum_{k=1}^n \left((a_{i,k} \otimes b_{k,j}) \oplus (a_{i,k} \otimes c_{k,j})\right)\\
            &= \left(\sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k} \otimes b_{k,j})\right) \oplus \left(\sum_{k=1}^n (a_{i,k} \otimes c_{k,j})\right)\\
            &= g_{i,j}\oplus h_{i,j}
        \end{align*}
        which means $\textbf{R} = \textbf{G} + \textbf{H}$.
    \end{itemize}
    As all the ring axioms are satisfied, thus $\Mn{n}{R}$ is a ring.
\end{proof}
For brevity, we let $\Mn{n}{R}$ denote the ring under matrix addition and multiplication.

\section{General Properties of Rings}
We list some properties of rings here. For each of the propositions, assume $R$ is a ring.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-multiplying-by-zero-is-zero}
    $0x = x0 = 0$ for all $x \in R$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We note that
    \begin{align*}
        0x &= (0 + 0)x & (0 \text{ is additive inverse})\\
        &= 0x + 0x & (\text{by \textbf{Distributive} axiom})
    \end{align*}
    so by `subtracting' $0x$ on both sides (i.e., adding $-0x$ on both sides) we see $0 = 0x$. A similar argument shows that $x0 = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-product-of-element-and-additive-inverse-is-additive-inverse-of-product}
    $(-a)b = a(-b) = -(ab)$ for any $a$ and $b$ in $R$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We show that $(-a)b = -(ab)$ and $a(-b) = -(ab)$ to complete the proof.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note $(-a)b + ab = (-a + a)b = 0b = 0$ by \textbf{Distributive} axiom. Hence by subtracting $ab$ on both sides we see $(-a)b = -(ab)$.
        \item Note also $a(-b) + ab = a(-b + b) = a0 = 0$ by \textbf{Distributive} axiom. Hence by subtracting $ab$ on both sides we see $a(-b) = -(ab)$.
    \end{itemize}
    Result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    $(-a)(-b) = ab$ for any $a$ and $b$ in $R$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    See \myref{exercise-product-of-additive-inverses} (later).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    If $R$ has an identity, it is unique.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose 1 and $1'$ are identities, and consider the sum $1 + 1'$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        1 + 1' &= 1'(1+1') & (\text{multiplying by identity }1')\\
        &= 1'1 + 1'1' & (\text{by \textbf{Distributive} axiom})\\
        &= 1' + 1'. & (1 \text{ and } 1' \text{ are identities})
    \end{align*}
    Subtracting $1'$ on both sides yields $1 = 1'$, meaning that the identity is unique.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{exercise-product-of-additive-inverses}
    Show that $(-a)(-b) = ab$ for any $a$ and $b$ in $R$.
\end{exercise}

\section{More Definitions}
Suppose $R$ is a ring.
\begin{definition}
    We say that $a \neq 0$ is a \textbf{zero divisor}\index{zero divisor} if there exists a $b \neq 0$ such that $ab = 0$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Consider the ring $\Zn{12}$. Clearly 4 and 6 are in $\Zn{12}$, and their product is $24 = 2 \times 12 = 0$ in $\Zn{12}$. Hence 4 and 6 are zero divisors in $\Zn{12}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    We claim that the ring
    \[
        R = \{f: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]\}
    \]
    has zero divisors. Consider the functions
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= x\\
        g(x) &= \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{ if } x \neq 0\\
            1 & \text{ if } x = 0
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Clearly neither of them are the zero function. However, consider $f(x)g(x)$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $x \neq 0$, then $g(x) = 0$ which means $f(x)g(x) = 0$.
        \item If $x = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ which means $f(x)g(x) = 0$.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence their product is the zero function, meaning that $R$ has zero divisors $f$ and $g$.
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}
    Does the ring $\Mn{2}{\mathbb{R}}$ have zero divisors?
\end{exercise}

\begin{definition}
    Suppose $0 \neq 1$. An element $u \in R$ is called a \textbf{unit}\index{unit} if there exists a $v \in R$ such that $uv=vu=1$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Equivalently, we say that $u$ is a unit if it has a multiplicative inverse.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
    3 and 7 are units in $\Zn{10}$ since $3 \times 7 = 7 \times 3 = 21 = 1$ in $\Zn{10}$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
    If every non-zero element $x \in R$ is a unit, then $R$ is said to be a \textbf{division ring}\index{division ring}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A commutative division ring is called a \textbf{field}\index{field}.
\end{definition}
We look at fields in more detail in Volume III.

\section{Subrings}
We end this chapter off with an exploration about subrings.

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ be a ring and $S$ be a subset of $R$. Then $S$ is a \textbf{subring}\index{subring} of $R$ if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(S, +) \leq (R, +)$, i.e. the set $S$ under addition is a subgroup of $R$ under addition; and
        \item For all $a$ and $b$ in $S$ we have $ab \in S$, i.e. $S$ is closed under multiplication.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Alternatively, one may show that $S$ is a ring to prove that $S$ is a subring of $R$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    We know that $\Z$ and $\Q$ are rings, and clearly $\Z \subseteq \Q$. Hence $\Z$ is a subring of $\Q$. Similarly, $\Q$ is a subring of $\R$, and $\R$ is a subring of $\C$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Consider the \textbf{gaussian integers}\index{gaussian integers},
    \[
        \Z[i] = \{a + bi \vert a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\},
    \]
    where $i$ is the imaginary unit (i.e., $i^2 = -1$). We will show that $\Z[i]$ is a subring of $\C$.
    \begin{proof}
        Clearly $\Z[i] \subseteq \C$. We show that $(\Z[i], +) \leq (\C, +)$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clearly the identity of $(\C, +)$, which is 0, is inside $(\Z[i], +)$ as $0 = 0 + 0i$.
            \item For any $a + bi, c+di \in \Z[i]$, we have $(a+bi) + (-(c+di)) = (a-c) + (b-d)i \in \Z[i]$.
        \end{itemize}
        Therefore by subgroup test we see $(\Z[i], +) \leq (\C, +)$.

        Now we show that $\Z[i]$ is closed under multiplication. Let $a + bi, c+di \in \Z[i]$. Then their product is
        \begin{align*}
            (a+bi)(c+di) &= ac+adi+bci+bdi^2\\
            &= (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i
            &\in \Z[i]
        \end{align*}
        so $\Z[i]$ is closed under multiplication. Therefore $\Z[i]$ is a subring of $\C$.
    \end{proof}
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}
    Show that
    \[
        R = \left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&a\\a&a\end{pmatrix} \vert a \in \R\right\}
    \]
    is a subring of $\Mn{2}{\mathbb{R}}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We note the following.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: $(\{0\}, +)$ is an abelian group by Volume I.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: $(\{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group by Volume I.
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: We know $+$ and $\cdot$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\{0\}, +, \cdot)$ is a commutative ring with identity.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Basics of Rings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We note the following.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Addition-Abelian}: $(\Z, +)$ is an abelian group by Volume I.
        \item \textbf{Multiplication-Semigroup}: $(\Z, \times)$ is a semigroup since
        \begin{itemize}
            \item multiplying two integers always results in an integer, so $\Z$ is closed under $\times$; and
            \item $\times$ is associative.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Distributive}: We know $+$ and $\times$ distribute.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(\Z, +, \times)$ is a ring.

    \item Consider $(-a)(-b) + (-ab)$ and note
    \begin{align*}
        &(-a)(-b) + (-ab)\\
        &= (-a)(-b) + (-a)b & (\text{\myref{prop-product-of-element-and-additive-inverse-is-additive-inverse-of-product}})\\
        &= (-a)(-b + b) & (\text{by \textbf{Distributive} axiom})\\
        &= (-a)0\\
        &= 0 & (\myref{prop-multiplying-by-zero-is-zero})
    \end{align*}
    which means $(-a)(-b) = -(-ab) = ab$ as required.

    \item The ring $\Mn{2}{\mathbb{R}}$ indeed has zero divisors, as $\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix} \neq \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$ but $\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$ which means that $\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$ is a zero divisor.
    
    \item We first show that $(R, +) \leq (\Mn{2}{\R}, +)$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clearly the identity of $(\Mn{2}{\R}, +)$, the zero matrix $\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$, is inside $R$.
        \item Consider $\begin{pmatrix}a&a\\a&a\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}b&b\\b&b\end{pmatrix} \in R$. The additive inverse of $\begin{pmatrix}b&b\\b&b\end{pmatrix}$ is $\begin{pmatrix}-b&-b\\-b&-b\end{pmatrix}$, and so their sum is
        \[
            \begin{pmatrix}a&a\\a&a\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}-b&-b\\-b&-b\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}a-b&a-b\\a-b&a-b\end{pmatrix} \in R
        \]
        which means $R$ is closed under addition.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence $(R, +) \leq (\Mn{2}{\R}, +)$ by subgroup test.

    We now show that $R$ is closed under multiplication. Some calculation yields that
    \[
        \begin{pmatrix}a&a\\a&a\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}b&b\\b&b\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}2ab&2ab\\2ab&2ab\end{pmatrix}
    \]
    which is clearly in $R$. Therefore $R$ is a subring of $\Mn{2}{\R}$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Basics of Rings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $R$ is a ring where 0 = 1, and let $x \in R$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        x &= 1x & (1 \text{ is the multiplicative identity})\\
        &= 0x & (0 = 1)\\
        &= 0 & (0x = 0 \text{ for all }x)
    \end{align*}
    which means that $R$ only contains one element, namely the identity 0. Hence the trivial ring is the unique ring where 0 = 1.

    \item Since $(R, \ast, \ast)$ is a ring, we know that $(R, \ast)$ is an abelian group and that $a \ast(b\ast c) = (a \ast b) \ast (a \ast c)$ for all $a, b, c \in R$ (left distribution). Consider an element $x \in R$. Thus we must have
    \[
        x \ast (x \ast x) = (x \ast x) \ast (x \ast x)    
    \]
    which means $x^3 = x^4$. Since $(R, \ast)$ is a group, thus $x^{-3}$ exists. Applying that on both sides means $x = e$ where $e$ is the identity. Therefore, $R$ contains only one element, the identity, which means that $(R, \ast, \ast)$ is actually the trivial ring.
