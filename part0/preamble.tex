    To understand the subject material covered in the later parts, the preliminaries and fundamentals must first be understood. This part gives one sufficient knowledge to dive into the meat of abstract algebra. We cover mathematical logic, important facts about algebra, basic set theory, functions and maps, and proof writing, elementary number theory, and simple modular arithmetic, which should be plenty for one to understand the content covered in future parts.
