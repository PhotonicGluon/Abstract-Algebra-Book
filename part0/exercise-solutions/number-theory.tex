    \item $44100 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 7^2$.
    \item $-210 = 11 - 13 \times 17$, so $a = 11$ and $b = 17$.
    \item $\gcd(-112, -35) = 7$ since $-112 = -16 \times 7$ and $-35 = -5 \times 7$, with 7 being the largest integer that achieves this.
    \item $\lcm(-112, -35) = 560$ since $560 = -5 \times -112$ and $-35 = -16 \times -35$, with 560 being the smallest \textit{positive} integer that achieves this.
    \item \begin{partquestions}{\roman*}
        \item $\gcd(42, 70) = 14$ since $42 = 3 \times 14$ and $70 = 5 \times 14$, and 14 is the largest integer achieving this.
        \item $\lcm(42, 70) = \frac{42 \times 70}{\gcd(m, n)} = \frac{2940}{14} = 210$ by \myref{prop-product-of-gcd-and-lcm}.
        \item Note that $x = 2$ and $y = -1$ works as $42 \times 2 + 70 \times (-1) = 84 - 70 = 14$.
