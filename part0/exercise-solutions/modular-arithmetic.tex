    \item \begin{partquestions}{\alph*}
        \item $17 \mod 5 = 2$ since $17 = 3 \times 5 + 2$ by the division algorithm.
        \item As $19 = 3 \times 5 + 4$, thus $19 \equiv 4 \pmod 5$. Hence $x = 4$.
        \item $A \mod n = 5 \mod 3 = 2$.
    \end{partquestions}
    
    \item $-n = (-1) \times 2n + n$, which means that $-n \equiv n \pmod{2n}$.
    
    \item Finding the last two digits of a number is the same as finding the remainder of that number when divided by 100. We note $778899 \equiv 99 \pmod{100}$, so $778899^{112233} \equiv 99^{112233} \pmod{100}$. Furthermore, $99 \equiv -1 \pmod{100}$, so $99^{112233}\equiv (-1)^{112233} \equiv -1 \equiv 99 \pmod{100}$. Hence the last two digits of $778899^{112233}$ are both 9.
    
    \item Note $123 \equiv 3 \pmod 5$. One can easily find by trial and error that 2 is the multiplicative inverse of 3, since $3 \times 2 = 6 \equiv 1 \pmod 5$. Hence the multiplicative inverse of 123 is 2 modulo 5.
