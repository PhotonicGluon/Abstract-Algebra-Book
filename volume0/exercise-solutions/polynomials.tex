    \item \begin{partquestions}{\alph*}
        \item The degree of $f(x)$ is 2 and the degree of $g(x)$ is 3, so $\deg(fg(x)) = \deg(f(x))\deg(g(x)) = 2 \times 3 = 6$.
        \item We note $f(x)g(x) = 4x^5+3x^4+6x^3+4x^2+2x+1$, so the term with degree 4 is $3x^4$.
    \end{partquestions}

    \item We note that
    \[
        x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2+2x+4) + 6
    \]
    so $Q(x) = x^2+2x+4$ and $R(x) = 6$.

    \item The term with degree 6 is
    \[
        {9 \choose 7}(7x)^7(-3)^{9-7} = -266827932x^6
    \]
    so its coefficient is -266827932.
