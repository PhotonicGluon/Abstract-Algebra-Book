    \item Yes. One sees that both $x^3 + x + 1$ and $x^3 + x^2 + 1$ are irreducible over $\Z_2$ since they both do not have zeroes in $\Z_2$ (\myref{thrm-degree-2-or-3-irreducible-iff-has-no-zeroes}). Hence both $\Z_2[x]/\princ{x^3+x+1}$ and $\Z_2/\princ{x^3+x^2+1}$ are fields of order $2^3 = 8$, which means that they are isomorphic.
