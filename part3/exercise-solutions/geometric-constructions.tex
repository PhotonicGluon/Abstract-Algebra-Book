\begin{questions}
    \item We know that $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$, which means that $\cos\theta = \sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta}$. So if $\sin\theta$ is constructible, so is $\sin^2\theta$, $1 - \sin^2\theta$, and $\sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta} = \cos\theta$ by the results about constructible numbers. Similarly we see $\sin\theta = \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}$, so if $\cos\theta$ is constructible so is $\sin\theta$.
    
    \item Let $\gamma$ be a constructible number. Then by \myref{thrm-condition-for-constructability} we know that $[\Q(\gamma):\Q] = 2^k$ for some integer $k$, meaning that $\Q(\gamma)$ is a finite extension of $\Q$ and is hence algebraic (\myref{thrm-finite-extension-is-algebraic}), which hence means that $\gamma$ is algebraic over $\Q$. Therefore any constructible number is algebraic over $\Q$, proving that $\mathfrak{C}$ is an algebraic extension of $\Q$.

    \item We note that $8x^3 - 6x - 1$ is irreducible if and only if $8\left(\frac12x\right)^3 - 6\left(\frac12x\right) - 1 = x^3 - 3x - 1$ is irreducible by a corollary of the transformation rule (\myref{corollary-irreducible-iff-constant-factor-multiple-is-irreducible}). Reducing the coefficients of the new polynomial modulo 2 yields $f(x) = x^3 + x + 1$. Note $f(0) = 1 \neq 0$ and $f(1) = 3 = 1 \neq 0$ so $f(x)$ has no zeroes in $\Z_2$ which means that it is irreducible over $\Z_2$ (\myref{thrm-degree-2-or-3-irreducible-iff-has-no-zeroes}). Hence $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\Q$ by Mod 2 Irreducibility Test (\myref{thrm-mod-p-irreducibility-test}) which therefore means $8x^3 - 6x - 1$ is irreducible over $\Q$.
