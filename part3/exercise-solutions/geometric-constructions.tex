    \item We know that $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$, which means that $\cos\theta = \sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta}$. So if $\sin\theta$ is constructible, so is $\sin^2\theta$, $1 - \sin^2\theta$, and $\sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta} = \cos\theta$ by the results about constructible numbers. Similarly we see $\sin\theta = \sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}$, so if $\cos\theta$ is constructible so is $\sin\theta$.
    
    \item Let $\gamma$ be a constructible number. Then by \myref{thrm-condition-for-constructability} we know that $[\Q(\gamma):\Q] = 2^k$ for some integer $k$, meaning that $\Q(\gamma)$ is a finite extension of $\Q$ and is hence algebraic (\myref{thrm-finite-extension-is-algebraic}), which hence means that $\gamma$ is algebraic over $\Q$. Therefore any constructible number is algebraic over $\Q$, proving that $\Con$ is an algebraic extension of $\Q$.
