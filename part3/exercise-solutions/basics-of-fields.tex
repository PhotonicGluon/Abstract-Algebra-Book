        \item Clearly $0 = 0 - 0$ since $x - x = 0$ for all elements $x$ in $F$, including $x = 0$. But since 0 is the additive identity, this means $0 + x = x$ for all $x$, including $x = -0$. Hence $0 = -0$.
        \item Clearly $1 = 1\times 1^{-1}$ since $xx^{-1} = 1$ for all $x \in F^\ast$, including $x = 1$. But since 1 is the multiplicative identity, this means $1x = x$ for all $x$, including $x = 1^{-1}$. So $1 = 1^{-1}$.
