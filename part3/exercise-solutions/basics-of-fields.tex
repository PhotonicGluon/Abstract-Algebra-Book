    \item \begin{partquestions}{\alph*}
        \item Clearly $0 = 0 - 0$ since $x - x = 0$ for all elements $x$ in $F$, including $x = 0$. But since 0 is the additive identity, this means $0 + x = x$ for all $x$, including $x = -0$. Hence $0 = -0$.
        \item Clearly $1 = 1\times 1^{-1}$ since $xx^{-1} = 1$ for all $x \in F^\ast$, including $x = 1$. But since 1 is the multiplicative identity, this means $1x = x$ for all $x$, including $x = 1^{-1}$. So $1 = 1^{-1}$.
    \end{partquestions}

    \item We already proved that $\Q[\sqrt{d}]$ is a field (\myref{prop-quadratic-field-is-a-field}). Now if $d \geq 0$ then $\sqrt{d} \in \R$, meaning that $\Q[\sqrt{d}] \subset \R \subset \C$. If instead $d < 0$, we may write $d = -r$, so $\Q[\sqrt{d}] = \Q[\sqrt{-r}] = \Q[i\sqrt{r}] \subset \C$. Hence $\Q[\sqrt{d}]$ is a subfield of $\C$, by using the definition of a subfield.

    \item Disprove. $\Q$ is a proper subfield of $\R$.
