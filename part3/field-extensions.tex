\chapter{Extension Fields and Splitting Fields}
For all of the previous chapters, we have looked at `substructures', subsets of the original structure that are, themselves, of the same type. For groups, we looked at subgroups; for rings, we looked at subrings; for vector spaces, we looked at subspaces. For fields, we can go the `reverse' direction, by finding a larger field that contains the original field, called an extension field.
