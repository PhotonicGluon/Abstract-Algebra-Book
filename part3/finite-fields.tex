\chapter{Finite Fields}
Finite fields appear in many applications of algebra, including cryptography (like in the NTRU cryptosystem). We already found out that $\Z_p$ is a field, and that we may construct fields of prime-power order via the use of irreducible polynomials. In this chapter, we will discover one of the most surprising and important results relating to these fields.
