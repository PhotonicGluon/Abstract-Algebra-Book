\chapter{Vector Spaces}
Abstract algebra has three core structures -- groups, rings, and fields. So far, we have looked at groups and rings in detail, and touched on some basic properties of fields. However, to properly explore the structure of fields, we need to cover the basics of vector spaces, which are typically covered in a linear algebra course. We provide a concise overview of vectors and vector spaces here.
