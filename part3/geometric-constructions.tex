\chapter{Geometric Constructions}
Geometric constructions were a favourite of the ancient Greeks. They were particularly interested in constructions that could be created with just a compass and an unmarked straightedge. In this chapter, we explore how field theory can be used to answer ancient questions about some geometric constructions.
