\chapter{Rings and Encryption}
Rings have practical use in the real world. Recently, with the threat of quantum computers breaking traditional encryption such as the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption scheme, post-quantum encryption schemes were developed. We look at the NTRU encryption scheme, a polynomial-based and allegedly post-quantum resistant encryption scheme.
