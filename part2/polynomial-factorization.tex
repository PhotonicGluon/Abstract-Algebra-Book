\chapter{Factorization of Polynomials}
One of the underappreciated facts about working with polynomials with real coefficients, like in high school, is that they can be factored simply. The idea of an `irreducible' polynomial is simple to understand within the reals -- it simply cannot be `broken down' into `smaller' polynomials without `breaking the rules'. We explore how polynomials are factored in a more general setting -- polynomial rings.

\section{(Ir)reducible Polynomials}
We formally define what (ir)reducible polynomials are in a polynomial ring that is an integral domain.
\begin{definition}
    Let $D$ be an integral domain and $f(x) \in D[x]$ be a non-zero, non-unit polynomial. Then $f(x)$ is \textbf{irreducible over $D$}\index{polynomial!irreducible} if, whenever we write $f(x) = p(x)q(x)$ for some polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ in $D[x]$, then either $p(x)$ is a unit or $q(x)$ is a unit in $D[x]$.

    A non-zero, non-unit polynomial that is not irreducible over $D$ is said to be \textbf{reducible over $D$}\index{polynomial!reducible}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    The polynomial $x + 1$ is irreducible over $\Z$ since we are unable to express $x+1$ as a product of non-unit polynomials in $\Z[x]$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    The polynomial $2x + 2$ is reducible over $\Z$ since $2x+2 = 2(x+1)$ and both 2 and $x+1$ are not units in $\Z[x]$.
\end{example}

It is often more useful to talk about irreducible polynomials over a field. In this case, we have this useful theorem to simplify the task of determining the irreducibility of a polynomial.
\begin{theorem}\label{thrm-irreducible-iff-not-expressable-as-product-of-smaller-polynomials}
    Let $F$ be a field. A non-constant polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ with degree $n$ is irreducible if and only if $f(x)$ cannot be expressed as a product of two polynomials each of degree lower than $n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For the forward direction, assume that a non-constant polynomial $f(x)$ with degree $n$ is irreducible. So there does not exist two non-unit polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ such that $f(x) = p(x)q(x)$, which thus means that it cannot be expressed as two polynomials of degree lower than $n$.

    For the reverse direction, assume that $f(x)$ with degree $n$ cannot be expressed as a product of two polynomials of degree lower than $n$. This means that it is possible for $f(x) = p(x)q(x)$ where at least one of the polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ have degree $n$. Without loss of generality assume $p(x)$ has degree $n$, thereby meaning $q(x)$ has degree $n - n = 0$ (see \myref{thrm-polynomial-degree-properties}). Thus $q(x)$ is a constant polynomial, so $q(x) = u \in F$ (\myref{prop-constant-polynomial-iff-ring-element}). Note $u \neq 0$ since otherwise $f(x) = 0$, a constant polynomial (a contradiction). But every non-zero element in $F$ is a unit. Therefore the only factorization of $f(x)$ is as a product of a unit and a polynomial of equal degree. Thus $f(x)$ is irreducible.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    One sees that $2x^2 + 4$ is reducible over $\Z$ since $2x^2 + 4 = 2(x^2 + 2)$ and neither 2 nor $x^2 + 2$ are units in $\Z[x]$. However, in $\Q$, the given polynomial is irreducible by \myref{thrm-irreducible-iff-not-expressable-as-product-of-smaller-polynomials}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    The polynomial $2x^2 + 4$ is irreducible in $\Q$ and $\R$, but reducible in $\C$ since $2x^2 + 4 = (2x-4i)(x+2i)$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Let the polynomial $f(x) = 3x^2 - 6$. Which of the following integral domains is $f(x)$ irreducible?
    \begin{partquestions}{\alph*}
        \item $\Z$
        \item $\Q$
        \item $\R$
    \end{partquestions} 
\end{exercise}

\section{Reducibility Tests}
Trying to see if a polynomial is (ir)reducible by definition is not a trivial task. For example, it is hard to see that $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\Z_3$ but reducible over $\Z_5$ by just using the definition directly. Therefore we develop some tests for (ir)reducibility to more easily see which polynomials are reducible or irreducible.

The first test applies to fields and polynomials of degree 2 or 3.
\begin{theorem}\label{thrm-degree-2-or-3-reducible-iff-has-zero}
    Let $F$ be a field. If $f(x) \in F[x]$ has degree 2 or 3, then $f(x)$ is reducible over $F$ if and only if $f(x)$ has a zero in $F$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We first work in the forward direction, assuming that $f(x) \in F[x]$ has degree $n \in \{2, 3\}$ and is reducible. Then $f(x) = p(x)q(x)$ where both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ have degrees less than $n$ (\myref{thrm-irreducible-iff-not-expressable-as-product-of-smaller-polynomials}). Note $n = \deg p(x) + \deg q(x)$, if $n = 2$ then both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ must have degree 1, and if $n = 3$ then at one of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ has degree 1. So we know that at least one of $p(x)$ or $q(x)$ has degree 1. Without loss of generality assume $p(x)$ has degree 1; set $p(x) = ax + b$ where $a,b \in F$. Note $a^{-1} \in F$; setting $\alpha = -a^{-1}b$ we see
    \begin{align*}
        f(\alpha) &= (a\alpha+b)q(\alpha)\\
        &= \left(a\left(-a^{-1}b\right) + b\right)q(\alpha)\\
        &= \left(-aa^{-1}b + b\right)q(\alpha)\\
        &= (-b+b)q(\alpha)\\
        &= 0.
    \end{align*}
    Since $\alpha \in F$ thus $\alpha$ is a zero of $f(x)$.

    For the reverse direction, if $f(x)$ has a zero in $F$, say $\alpha$, then by factor theorem (\myref{corollary-factor-theorem}) we know $(x-\alpha)$ is a factor of $f(x)$ and thus is reducible over $F$.
\end{proof}

\myref{thrm-degree-2-or-3-reducible-iff-has-zero} is particularly useful for finite fields, since we just have to check all elements of the field for a zero.

\begin{example}
    Consider the opening example: the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 + 1$. In $\Z_3$, we note that
    \begin{align*}
        f(0) &= 0^2 + 1 = 1 \neq 0,\\
        f(1) &= 1^2 + 1 = 2 \neq 0, \text{ and}\\
        f(2) &= 2^2 + 1 = 5 = 2 \neq 0,
    \end{align*}
    so $f(x)$ is not reducible (i.e., irreducible) over $\Z_3$ by \myref{thrm-degree-2-or-3-reducible-iff-has-zero}. However, note that $f(2) = 5 = 0$ in $\Z_5$, meaning $f(x)$ has a zero in $\Z_5$. Thus $x^2 + 1$ is reducible over $\Z_5$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Consider the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 - 2$. One sees that $f(3) = 3^2 - 2 = 7 = 0$ in $\Z_7$, so $f(x)$ is reducible in the field $\Z_7$. However $f(x)$ is not reducible in $\Q$ since it has no zeroes in $\Q$. But $f(x)$ is reducible in $\R$ since $f(\sqrt2) = 0$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    The theorem fails for polynomials with degree of at least 4. For example, $f(x) = x^4 + 2x^2 + 1$ is reducible in $\Q$ since $x^4 + 2x^2 + 1 = (x^2+1)^2$, but $f(x)$ has no zeroes in $\Q$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
    Let the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^3 + 4x + 9$. For which field(s) listed below is $f(x)$ irreducible?
    \begin{partquestions}{\alph*}
        \item $\Z_2$
        \item $\Z_3$
        \item $\Z_5$
        \item $\Z_7$
    \end{partquestions}
\end{exercise}

Before we introduce the next test for reducibility, which involves polynomials with integer coefficients, we first introduce some terminology and a result to ease the proof of the test.

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{content}\index{polynomial!content} of a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients is the GCD of the coefficients.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{primitive polynomial}\index{polynomial!primitive} is a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients and content 1.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Gauss]\index{Gauss's Lemma}
    The product of two primitive polynomials is primitive.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof (see {\cite[p.~291]{gallian_2016}})]
    Seeking a contradiction, suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are primitive polynomials with a non-primitive product $h(x) = f(x)g(x)$. Therefore the content of $h(x)$ is not 1; in fact it is at least 2, meaning the content of $h(x)$ is either prime or composite.
    
    Let $p$ be a prime divisor of the content of $h(x)$, and let $\bar{f}(x)$, $\bar{g}(x)$, and $\bar{h}(x)$ be polynomials obtained from $f(x)$, $g(x)$, and $h(x)$ by reducing their coefficients modulo $p$. Since the content of $h(x)$ is not 1, thus coefficients of $h(x)$ are multiples of $p$; accordingly when they are reduced modulo $p$, we see $\bar{h}(x) = 0$. Also, we may interpret $\bar{f}(x)$ and $\bar{g}(x)$ as polynomials belonging in $\Z_p[x]$ where $(\bar{f}(x))(\bar{g}(x)) = \bar{h}(x) = 0$. Since $\Z_p[x]$ is an integral domain (\myref{thrm-integral-domain-iff-polynomial-ring-is-integral-domain}), this means that $\bar{f}(x) = 0$ or $\bar{g}(x) = 0$. Without loss of generality assume $\bar{f}(x) = 0$. Therefore $p$ divides every coefficient of $f(x)$, meaning that the content of $f(x)$ is at least $p$, i.e. $f(x)$ is not primitive, a contradiction.

    The contradiction means that a product of two primitive polynomials must be primitive.
