\chapter{Factorization of Polynomials}
One of the underappreciated facts about working with polynomials with real coefficients, like in high school, is that they can be factored simply. The idea of an `irreducible' polynomial is simple to understand within the reals -- it simply cannot be `broken down' into `smaller' polynomials without `breaking the rules'. We explore how polynomials are factored in a more general setting -- polynomial rings.
