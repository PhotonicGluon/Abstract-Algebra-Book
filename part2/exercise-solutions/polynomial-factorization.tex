\section{Factorization of Polynomials}
\begin{questions}
    \item Not irreducible since $3x^2 - 6 = 3(x^2-2)$ and both 3 and $x^2-2$ are non-units in $\Z$.
    \item Irreducible in $\Q$ since we cannot express $3x^2-6$ as a product of two polynomial of smaller degree that are in $\Q[x]$ (by \myref{thrm-irreducible-iff-not-expressable-as-product-of-smaller-polynomials}).
    \item Reducible in $\R$ since $3x^2 - 6 = (3x-3\sqrt2)(x+\sqrt2)$ and both $3x-3\sqrt2, x+\sqrt2 \in \R[x]$.
\end{questions}
