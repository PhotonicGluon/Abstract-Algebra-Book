    \item We claim that $x+2$ is its own inverse when $N = 2$ and $p = 4$, since
    \begin{align*}
        (x+2)^2 &= x^2 + 4x + 4\\
        &= x^0 + 4x + 4 & (\text{reduce powers modulo } N = 2)\\
        &= 4x + 5\\
        &= 1 & (\text{reduce coefficients modulo } p = 4)
    \end{align*}

    \item Suppose $f(x) \in \mathcal{L}(k,k)$. Then $f(x)$ has exactly $k$ coefficients of 1 and $k$ coefficients of -1. Therefore, evaluating $f(1)$ yields a result of 0.
    
    The equivalent requirement for $f(x)$ to have an inverse modulo $p$, say $F_p(x)$, is that $F_p(x)f(x) = 1$ within the ring $\Z_p[x]$. However $f(1) = 0$, meaning that $f(x)$ has a zero in $\Z_p$, while the constant polynomial 1 does not. Therefore, there cannot be a polynomial $F_p(x)$ such that $F_p(x)f(x) = 1$ in $\Z_p[x]$, i.e. $f(x)$ does not have an inverse.

    \item Alice's public key is
    \begin{align*}
        h(x) &= F_{16}g(x)\\
        &= (7x^5 + 5x^4 + 14x^3 + 9x^2 + 12x + 2)(x^4 - x^3 - x + 1)\\
        &= 7x^9 - 2x^8 + 9x^7 - 12x^6 + 5x^5 - 19x^4 + 3x^3 - 3x^2 + 10x + 2\\
        &= 7x^3 - 2x^2 + 9x - 12 + 5x^5 - 19x^4 + 3x^3 - 3x^2 + 10x + 2\\
        &= 5x^5 - 19x^4 + 10x^3 - 5x^2 + 19x - 10\\
        &\equiv 5x^5 + 13x^4 + 10x^3 + 11x^2 + 3x + 6 \pmod{16}.
    \end{align*}
