\section{Domains and Factorization}
\begin{questions}
    \item Suppose $r$ is an irreducible and $q$ an associate of $r$, meaning there exists a unit $u$ in the integral domain (say $D$) such that $q = ru$. Suppose on the contrary that $q$ is reducible, meaning $q = ab$ where neither $a$ nor $b$ are units in $D$. Then $ru = ab$ which means $r = (u^{-1}a)b$. As $r$ is irreducible we know that either $b$ is a unit (contradicting the assumption) or $u^{-1}a$ is a unit. Since the product of units is a unit, thus $u(u^{-1}a) = a$ is a unit, contradicting the assumption. Therefore $q = ru$ is irreducible.
