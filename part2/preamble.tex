        [Some] of the major discoveries in ring theory have helped shape the course of development of modern abstract algebra... A course in ring theory is an indispensable part of the education of any fledgling algebraist.

    The investigation into the properties of rings is primarily motivated by rings' connections to other fields in mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and commutative algebra. The discovery of results relating to rings reveals deeper connections in related algebraic structures, such as fields. Results relating to rings are often technical but are necessary as they provide the underpinnings of more useful results in other areas.
