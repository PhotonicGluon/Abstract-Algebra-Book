\section{Domains and Factorization}
\begin{questions}
    \item We induct on $n$. When $n = 2$, this reduces down to the definition of a prime element in an integral domain. Now suppose $p \vert a_1a_2\cdots a_k$ for some $k \geq 2$. We are to show that this works for $k + 1$.
    
    Note $p \vert a_1a_2\cdots a_ka_{k+1}$ is the same as $p \vert (a_1a_2\cdots a_k)a_{k+1}$. By definition of a prime element we know that $p \vert a_1a_2\cdots a_k$ or $p \vert a_{k+1}$. Therefore, using induction hypothesis on the former, we see $p\vert a_1$, or $p\vert a_2$, or $p \vert a_3$, etc., or $p \vert a_k$, or $p_ \vert a_{k+1}$, which proves the statement for $k + 1$.

    Therefore by induction we establish the required result.
